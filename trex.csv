The mediating effect of job satisfaction on the link between employees’ motivation and job performance,10.21203/rs.3.rs-2158214/v1,0,Berhanu Endeshaw,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
        <jats:p>The aim of the study was to examine the mediating effect of job satisfaction on the link between employees’ motivation and job performance. Stratified sampling in conjunction with simple random sampling techniques was employed to draw respondents from Tikur Anebessa Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Data processing used descriptive statistics, correlation and multiple regression with the help of SPSS and Amos 23 software. The result of the study found that the entire independent variables and mediator had positive relation and significant effect (i.e. explained by 53.4%) on job performance. The mediating variable (job satisfaction) has shown partially mediated the independent (employees’ motivation) and dependent variable (job performance). It is therefore recommended that motivation and job satisfaction should be taken into consideration to enhance employee job performance.</jats:p>",job satisfaction,5.0,,Research Square Platform LLC,,posted-content

"Analysis of the Importance of Job Insecurity, Psychological Safety and Job Satisfaction in the CSR-Performance Link",10.3390/su12093514,0,Min-Jik Kim; Byung-Jik Kim,"<jats:p>Existing works on the association between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and performance have investigated how CSR affects external stakeholders (e.g., shareholders, customers, local communities, and environment). However, the effect of CSR on internal stakeholders such as employees who ultimately determine organizational performance is relatively underexplored. Institutional theory suggests that institutional enablers, e.g., CSR practices, influence macro-level variables, like organizational performance, via micro-level intermediating processes, such as perceptions, attitudes and behaviors of employees. Thus, this paper proposes that internal mechanisms are essential to explain the CSR-performance link. Using a 3-wave time-lagged survey data of 301 workers in South Korean firms (144 men and 157 women, average age: 40.30), this research examines how psychological safety and job satisfaction of an employee function as sequential mediators in the CSR-performance link. Moreover, the current research also investigates how job insecurity negatively moderates the link between CSR and psychological safety. The results demonstrated that psychological safety and job satisfaction function as sequential internal mediators in the link. In addition, job insecurity negatively moderated the influence of CSR on psychological safety. The results suggest that an employee’s perceptions and attitudes, such as job insecurity, psychological safety, and job satisfaction, significantly influence the relationship between CSR and performance.</jats:p>",job satisfaction,5.0,,MDPI AG,Sustainability,journal-article

The Link between Relative Pay and Job Satisfaction Revisited,10.1093/esr/jcaa045,2021,Matthias Collischon; Andreas Eberl,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper investigates the connection between job satisfaction and comparison pay (defined as a person’s rank within a reference group) with SOEP Data. Based on work values and social networks, we argue that the existing literature neglects heterogeneities in individual job satisfaction as well as wage trajectories along the career path. Thus, previous studies based on survey data likely overestimate the connection between job satisfaction and comparison pay. We use fixed-effects individual slopes models to account for heterogeneous time trends between individuals. We find no statistically significant correlation between comparison pay and job satisfaction. We conclude that previous estimates were biased by not accounting for idiosyncratic trends in job satisfaction due to unobserved heterogeneity, which led to an omitted variable bias.</jats:p>",job satisfaction,6.2,http://academic.oup.com/esr/article-pdf/37/2/238/36676960/jcaa045.pdf,Oxford University Press (OUP),European Sociological Review,journal-article

Overqualification as Moderator for the Link Between Job Change and Job Satisfaction Among Immigrants and Natives in Germany,10.31235/osf.io/q7nu2,0,Samir Khalil; Almuth Lietz; Sabrina Jasmin Mayer,"<p>Job satisfaction is a major driver of an individual’s subjective well-beingand thus affects public health, societal prosperity, and organisations, asdissatisfied employees are less productive and more likely to change jobs.However, changing jobs does not necessarily lead to higher job satisfactionin the long run. Previous studies have shown, instead, that changingjobs only increases job satisfaction for a short period of time beforeit gradually falls back to similar levels as before. This phenomenon isknown as the ’honeymoon–hangover’ pattern. In our study, we identifyan important new moderator of the relation between job change and jobsatisfaction: the job–qualification match of job change. Based on relativedeprivation theory, we argue that a job change from being overqualified ina job lowers the likelihood of negative comparisons and thus increases thehoneymoon period and lessens the hangover period. In addition, we investigatewhether this moderating effect is less pronounced among immigrants,since the phenomenon of overqualification occurs more frequentlyamong immigrants. We use data from the Socio-Economic Panel rangingfrom 1994–2018 and focus specifically on individual periods of employeesbefore and after job changes (N=134,417). Our results confirm that achange to a job that requires a matched qualification has a stronger andlonger-lasting effect on job satisfaction, and that this effect is slightly lowerfor respondents born abroad.</p>",job satisfaction,5.0,,Center for Open Science,,posted-content

A New Type of Standardized Statistical Work,10.23943/princeton/9780691179476.003.0002,2020,Arunabh Ghosh,"<p>This chapter explores early statistical work in the People's Republic of China's (PRC) Northeast, arguing that this work and the practical experience so gained was the foundation upon which the rest of the country's statistical apparatus was based. Unpacking the constituent elements of Wang Sihua's “new type of standardized statistical work” permits an articulation of the ways in which this new type of statistics was regarded as more standardized, correct, and scientific than what preceded it in the years before 1949. The chapter shows that the 1950s were shot through with the influence, rarely pedagogical or technical in nature but rather all-pervasive and methodological, of what by 1959 would come to be termed the Maoist model of ascertaining fact. This Maoist model, with its emphases on direct experience over technical knowledge and on ideological fervor as a source of expertise, rendered the earlier binary and the clean solutions it offered much more conflicted. As a result, statisticians and statistical workers throughout the 1950s found themselves not only transitioning from a “nonsocialist” to a “socialist” system of data collection and analysis but also operating in a milieu that particularly valued personal, individual, practical experience.</p>",work performance,1.0,,Princeton University Press,Making It Count,book-chapter

Work Performance of Print Media Employees: A Path Analysis using Organization and Psychological Behaviors,10.31235/osf.io/mfj8c,0,Rachel Advincula,"<p>This study determined the best fit model of work performance among print media employees in Region XI. In an attempt to answer the objective, a quantitative research method utilizing a descriptive-correlational research design was employed. The study was conducted in Region XI which is located at the Southeastern  part  of  Mindanao, Philippines. The employees of print media companies in Region XI were the respondents particularly those in printing press business industry that offers printing, publications, and adverting services. There were 419 employees of printing industry participated in the study. The study was employed the questionnaires adapted from different studies and to fit the context of the respondents of this study. The instrument was divided into four parts such as Innovative Work Behavior, Work Engagement, Organization learning and Work Performance. Results revealed that there is a significant relationship between innovative work behavior, organizational learning, work engagement and work performance of print media employees. Among the three independent variables, only the organizational learning and work engagement significantly predict employees work performance while the innovative work behavior does significantly predict employees work performance. Since organizational learning and work engagement were significant predictors of employees work performance, it is recommended that the management of print media will consider these variables in formulating training like advance multimedia, seminars on capacity building, and rewards and incentives program to improve employees work performance.</p>",work performance,5.0,,Center for Open Science,,posted-content

Origin–Destination Flow Estimation from Link Count Data Only,10.3390/s20185226,0,Subhrasankha Dey; Stephan Winter; Martin Tomko,"<jats:p>All established models in transportation engineering that estimate the numbers of trips between origins and destinations from vehicle counts use some form of a priori knowledge of the traffic. This paper, in contrast, presents a new origin–destination flow estimation model that uses only vehicle counts observed by traffic count sensors; it requires neither historical origin–destination trip data for the estimation nor any assumed distribution of flow. This approach utilises a method of statistical origin–destination flow estimation in computer networks, and transfers the principles to the domain of road traffic by applying transport-geographic constraints in order to keep traffic embedded in physical space. Being purely stochastic, our model overcomes the conceptual weaknesses of the existing models, and additionally estimates travel times of individual vehicles. The model has been implemented in a real-world road network in the city of Melbourne, Australia. The model was validated with simulated data and real-world observations from two different data sources. The validation results show that all the origin–destination flows were estimated with a good accuracy score using link count data only. Additionally, the estimated travel times by the model were close approximations to the observed travel times in the real world.</jats:p>",work performance,0.0,,MDPI AG,Sensors,journal-article

Employee engagement conceptualized as a positive work-related mind-set has demonstrated positive association with both supervisor support and colleague support. The study uses data collected from employees in organizations in Botswana (n = 438) to assess the relationship between social resources and employee engagement using Ubuntu as a mediating variable. Using mediation analysis, findings suggest that high levels of Ubuntu enhance the strength of the relationship among supervisor support, colleague support and employee engagement. These findings open significant potential for future studies identifying the cultural peculiarities as well as managerial implications of management concepts such as employee engagement in non-western settings and underlining the importance of the Ubuntu concept in managing staff in a sub-Saharan Africa country. </jats:p>",employee engagement,6.2,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/14705958211007874,SAGE Publications,International Journal of Cross Cultural Management,journal-article

<jats:p>This research paper concentrates on clarifying the link between employee engagement and organizational effectiveness, as well as the use of social media to boost these commercially desirable phenomena. The results show that engagement’s team commitment dimension was ranked highest, while the organizational strategy implementation dimension ranked the most negatively. Performance is therefore being leaked most significantly from this latter engagement category. Social media communication had a negative impact on employee engagement because it was executed poorly, leaving much room for leadership improvements. Understanding the psychology of presence and motivation is key to translating the potential for well-communicated action into reality.</jats:p>

Implementing different innovative strategies made by different organizations helps to improve performance levels and results in high productivity and profitability. It helps to upgrade the organization's profile and reputation. Challenges faced by the organization include the fulfillment of the need and requirements of the employees associated with job satisfaction along with the safety and security of the job role.

Employee Engagement as Motivation: Practitioner Models,10.31124/advance.13270571.v1,0,Jeremy Pincus,"<jats:p>Despite employee engagement’s centrality as a construct, clear theoretical and operational definitions are few and far between. We argue for re-conceptualizing engagement, grounding it in the vast psychological literature on human motivation. Herein lies the paper’s contribution; we argue that the apparent conceptual proliferation can be understood as attempts to draw ever nearer to key motivational concepts. We review engagement definitions and find that they are reducible to a comprehensive taxonomy of twelve human motives. We consider the impact of rooting engagement in existing motivational constructs for each of the following: (a) theory, especially the development of engagement systems; (b) methods, including the value of applying a comprehensive, structural approach; and (c) practice, where we emphasize the practical advantages of clear operational definitions.</jats:p>",employee engagement,5.0,,SAGE Publications,,posted-content

Employee Engagement as Motivation: Practitioner Models,10.31124/advance.13270571,0,Jeremy Pincus,"<jats:p>Despite employee engagement’s centrality as a construct, clear theoretical and operational definitions are few and far between. We argue for re-conceptualizing engagement, grounding it in the vast psychological literature on human motivation. Herein lies the paper’s contribution; we argue that the apparent conceptual proliferation can be understood as attempts to draw ever nearer to key motivational concepts. We review engagement definitions and find that they are reducible to a comprehensive taxonomy of twelve human motives. We consider the impact of rooting engagement in existing motivational constructs for each of the following: (a) theory, especially the development of engagement systems; (b) methods, including the value of applying a comprehensive, structural approach; and (c) practice, where we emphasize the practical advantages of clear operational definitions.</jats:p>",employee engagement,5.0,,SAGE Publications,,posted-content

HRM and Employee Engagement Link: Mediating Role of Employee Well-being,10.1177/0972150917713369,2018,P. Sivapragasam; R. P. Raya,"<jats:p> The debate concerning the link between human resource management (HRM) and employee level as well as organizational outcomes has reached an interesting crossroads. While studies continue to demonstrate a relationship between financial success and the organization’s commitment to management practices that support people’s goals and treat people as assets, yet in reality, the focus on achieving short-term financial performance has obscured the consideration of people-oriented goals. Given the centrality of HRM practices to organizational success, this study reports the results of a survey conducted among 626 knowledge professionals working in IT companies in Chennai city of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The study found statistically significant relationship between HRM practices and employee-level outcomes such as perceived efficacy, engagement and employee well-being, where employee well-being plays a mediating role. The implications of the findings of the theory and practice of HRM have been discussed. </jats:p>",employee engagement,3.6,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0972150917713369,SAGE Publications,Global Business Review,journal-article

"Types of employee training, organizational identification, and turnover intention: evidence from Korean employees",10.21511/ppm.18(4).2020.41,2020,Ji-Young Ahn; Shilu Huang,"<jats:p>Many organizations are willing to increase human capital investment through various employee training programs. This study empirically examines a proposed model that explains the relationship between the different types of employee training, including general and firm-specific training and employee turnover in Korean firms. This study used a survey sample of 10,069 employees in 467 publicly traded firms in South Korea. 78% of participating companies provided training programs to the employees. This study conducted quantitative cross-sectional regression analyses to test the hypotheses. The study suggests empirical evidence that general training and firm-specific training reduce employee turnover intention. Moreover, the magnitude of firm-specific training on turnover intention is much higher than general training. Furthermore, employee organizational identification has a partial mediating effect on training and turnover intention. However, the study found no substantial evidence of the moderating effect of employees’ justice perception of receiving training opportunities. Based on the human capital theory and social exchange perspective, the results indicate that both types of training programs help employee retention, and cultivating employee organizational identification can be critical in the training-turnover process.</jats:p>",employee turnover,3.0,https://businessperspectives.org/images/pdf/applications/publishing/templates/article/assets/14539/PPM_2020_04_Ahn.pdf,LLC CPC Business Perspectives,Problems and Perspectives in Management,journal-article

It also aimed at examining the moderating role of job demand (time pressure) in the relationship of job resources and employee engagement. Data was collected from the employees of universities, including administrative employees and all academic employees (lecturer to professors). The findings exhibit that reward &amp; recognition affect turnover intention positively and significantly. It was also found by regression analysis that organizational support has a positive impact on employee engagement. Moreover, this study also found that time pressure has a moderating role in the relationship of reward &amp; recognition and employee engagement. Similarly, it was the findings of this study that negative moderation effect exists between the relationship of organizational support and employee engagement.

Origin–Destination Flow Estimation from Link Count Data Only,10.3390/s20185226,0,Subhrasankha Dey; Stephan Winter; Martin Tomko,"<jats:p>All established models in transportation engineering that estimate the numbers of trips between origins and destinations from vehicle counts use some form of a priori knowledge of the traffic. This paper, in contrast, presents a new origin–destination flow estimation model that uses only vehicle counts observed by traffic count sensors; it requires neither historical origin–destination trip data for the estimation nor any assumed distribution of flow. This approach utilises a method of statistical origin–destination flow estimation in computer networks, and transfers the principles to the domain of road traffic by applying transport-geographic constraints in order to keep traffic embedded in physical space. Being purely stochastic, our model overcomes the conceptual weaknesses of the existing models, and additionally estimates travel times of individual vehicles. The model has been implemented in a real-world road network in the city of Melbourne, Australia. The model was validated with simulated data and real-world observations from two different data sources. The validation results show that all the origin–destination flows were estimated with a good accuracy score using link count data only. Additionally, the estimated travel times by the model were close approximations to the observed travel times in the real world.</jats:p>",employee turnover,0.0,,MDPI AG,Sensors,journal-article

Effect of Psychological Contract on Employee Turnover Intention: Moderating Role of Select Demographic Variables,10.54517/esp.v9i5.1793,0,Neha Sharma; Sandeep Kaur,"<jats:p>Since the inception and the spread of COVID-19 from March 2020 in India, companies have experienced a rapid increase in the rate of unemployment as well as employee turnover intention. However, though employer appears to have additional power due to high unemployment levels, but it’s also been balanced by employees having new and more alternatives over whom they get employed due to extensive adoption of remote working by all the companies. Employees are highly satisfied at the workplace, prone to get retained with the organization, develop faith in the organizational system only if there is fulfillment of their psychological contract; employer’s showing concern for employees. This study aims to examine the relationship between psychological contract and employee turnover intention for the employees working in general insurance companies in India. The study further explores the moderating effect of select demographic variables for the relationship between psychological contract and employee turnover intention. These demographic variables are considered as independent groups and their moderation effect relationship between Psychological Contract and Employee Turnover Intention is tested with the help of SMART PLS software. The findings are insightful and will pave the way for the insurance companies to retain the employees by reducing their employee turnover intention and focusing on fulfillment of psychological contract.</jats:p>",employee turnover,5.0,https://esp.apacsci.com/index.php/esp/article/viewFile/1793/1221,Arts and Science Press Pte.
