The matched data contain both information on job satisfaction from the ECHP (European Community Household Panel) and information on establishment productivity from longitudinal register data that can be linked to the ECHP. The estimates for the effect of a one point increase in the establishment average level of employee job satisfaction, on a scale 1-6, on productivity vary depending on the specification of the model. The preferred estimate, based on the IV estimation that uses satisfaction with housing conditions as an instrument for job satisfaction, shows that the effect on value added per hours worked is ~20% in the manufacturing sector. The economic size of this effect is modest, because the observations are bunched towards the higher end of the satisfaction scale making it very difficult to increase the average level of job satisfaction in the establishment by one point.Job satisfaction; employee well-being; productivity; performance",

    "abstract": "The primary objective of this research paper is to examine workplace employee satisfaction and its influence on the effective utilization of organizational resources. This entails exploring the various factors that significantly impact employee satisfaction within an organization, with the goal of identifying key drivers that have a profound effect on the morale and motivation of the workforce. By understanding these crucial factors, organizations can employ diverse strategies to enhance employee performance, thereby maximizing both individual and organizational objectives.\nIn today\\u27s competitive market landscape, human resources are undeniably a critical asset for any organization. With intense competition, businesses are relentlessly striving to enhance customer satisfaction to gain a competitive edge. The utilization of human resources has a direct and substantial impact not only on customer satisfaction but also on gaining a competitive advantage. Consequently, it is imperative for managers to consistently assess employee satisfaction and pay close attention to the variables that exert significant influence on both employee satisfaction and performance. To investigate employee satisfaction and its ramifications on employee performance, this study employs a survey method. The utilization of an experimental approach is deemed unnecessary for this research, as employee satisfaction primarily involves theoretical aspects, making experimental methodologies redundant. Data for this research was collected through questionnaires, constituting primary data, targeting managers at various organizational levels within the private sector.\nThe analysis of the gathered data reveals a robust positive correlation between employee satisfaction and employee performance. Notably, the variables most closely associated with employee satisfaction, and subsequently, with a significant impact on employee performance, are employee creativity and reduced absenteeism. Consequently, it can be confidently asserted that there exists a strong, positive relationship between employee satisfaction, employee performance, and the attainment of organizational goals",

Design/methodology/approach: The statistical method used is the Structural Equation Model with a total sample of 112 respondents. This study uses a questionnaire to measure the factors affecting work satisfaction as compensation, motivation, organizational commitment, job satisfaction and employee performance. Findings: The results of this study found that there were positive and significant effects of compensation on the job satisfaction, and organizational commitment to job satisfaction as well as the effect of motivation on employee\u2019s performance. Moreover, the insignificant effect is found in the effect of the job satisfaction on employee performance, the motivation on the job satisfaction, the compensation towards the employee performance and the organizational commitment on the employee performance. Mediation test proves that the job satisfaction is able to mediate the effects of compensation, motivation and organizational commitment on employee performance. Practical Implications: The results of this study can be the basis for the management of automotive product distributors in Batam City to increase compensation, and motivation for employees to improve job satisfaction and company performance.

Additionally, we also aimed to explore which aspects of environmental comfort have the strongest impact on momentary wellbeing and productivity.\n\nFifteen knowledge workers in an open-plan office environment were sent a brief survey (measuring environmental comfort, momentary wellbeing, and perceived productivity) each day over an 11-day study period, and provided 78 individual survey responses in total.\n\nAll but one of the measures on the survey had low test-retest reliability, indicating that employees\u2019 experiences of environmental comfort varied significantly each time they completed the survey.  Additionally, higher environmental comfort was associated with improved wellbeing and productivity.\n\nThe results suggest that an experience sampling approach to the workplace occupant survey is justified to better capture the temporal variability in experiences of environmental comfort.  The results also suggest that improving environmental comfort, particularly by reducing the level of distractions, will enable employees to work more productively.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first field study which has attempted to directly address limitations in traditional occupant surveys by using an experience sampling approach rather than a one-time-only questionnaire",
