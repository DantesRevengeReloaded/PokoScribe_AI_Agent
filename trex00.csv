Job the True Sage,10.1093/oso/9780190885120.003.0004,2018,Michael C. Legaspi,"<p>In the book of Job, wisdom is contested. In the speeches of the friends, wisdom is a program based on a pious alignment with divine justice as manifest in the sacred, social, and cosmic orders. In the figure of Job, the reader is invited to reconsider the nature of piety on which this understanding of wisdom is based. Job raises the possibility that piety is a form of integrity that yields a different relation to order. Accordingly, piety does not consist in a knowledge of order that leads to a prosperous life but rather in the determination to hold one’s place within the order, to remain true to the inner dictates of one’s pious life. To do so is to inhabit an order in which the strange inexplicability of this determination is coordinated to the strangeness of the cosmos itself and to the will of an inscrutable God.</p>",job satisfaction,0.6,,Oxford University Press,Oxford Scholarship Online,book

The True Value of Open-Water Hydraulic Access Using Coiled Tubing,10.2118/199818-ms,2020,Mike Avery; Robert Greenaway; Robert Large; Phillip Rice,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>As the global well base continues to increase, it is becoming apparent that under-investment in maintenance has helped contribute to a decreasing average production per subsea well. To combat this trend, more focused and cost-effective intervention techniques have emerged such as open-water hydraulic access (OWHA) using coiled tubing (CT).</jats:p>
               <jats:p>OWHA using CT provides operators with a fit-for-purpose solution to deliver fluids to a subsea well without the requirement for mechanical intervention. In scenarios which meet the requirements outlined within this paper, OWHA using CT offers an attractive alternative to conventional intervention approaches.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Three predominant configurations of OWHA CT systems are apparent, all developed around differing drivers: a conventional system using a CT injector head (IH), a specialized system using a CT IH, and a powered reeler with deployment sheave. Both the benefits and limitations of each are considered to guide the reader in selecting the correct configuration for their application.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>The primary cost driver for hydraulic intervention is vessel selection. Factors including regional availability, mobilization requirements, and specification are key to the selection process. An advantage of OWHA using CT is the ability to use a vessel of opportunity due to the decreased equipment footprint and specification; this directly enhances service flexibility and cost management.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>When compared to alternative oil sources, the comparative cost per barrel of oil unlocked by OHWA is at least 43% less than the closest alternative. When compared to alternative intervention approaches, the simplified equipment and requirements result in a reduced total cost thus enhanced return on investment with accelerated payback.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Using average global vessel rates and generalized assumptions, for a single well intervention the total costs can be in the order of the following magnitudes: floating rig USD 9-16M, light well USD 6-10M, OWHA USD 2-5M. Using an average well production gain of 1,950 BOPD this gives a typical payback time period of ~9 months for a rig and ~3 months for OWHA.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>In scenarios which meet the requirements outlined within this paper, OWHA provides the most economical solution with the ability to provide positive returns in the same financial year.</jats:p>",job satisfaction,1.0,https://onepetro.org/SPECTWI/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/199818-MS/2353856/spe-199818-ms.pdf,SPE,SPE/ICoTA Well Intervention Conference and Exhibition,proceedings-article
Is Knowledge Justified True Belief?,10.31219/osf.io/yev3s,0,John Turri,"<p>Is knowledge justified true belief? Most philosophers believe that the answer is clearly ‘no’, as demonstrated by Gettier cases. But Gettier cases don’t obviously refute the traditional view that knowledge is justified true belief (JTB). There are ways of resisting Gettier cases, at least one of which is partly successful. Nevertheless, when properly understood, Gettier cases point to a flaw in JTB, though it takes some work to appreciate just what it is. The nature of the flaw helps us better understand the nature of knowledge and epistemic justification. I propose a crucial improvement to the traditional view, relying on an intuitive and independently plausible metaphysical distinction pertaining to the manifestation of intellectual powers, which supplements the traditional components of justification, truth and belief.</p>",job satisfaction,0.0,,Center for Open Science,,posted-content

Full-Text Search on Data with Access Control,10.31219/osf.io/4rwj5,0,Ahmad Zaky,"<p>Full-Text Search combined with access control has a wide range of applications. Unfortunately, there are only few (if not zero) researches that combine the two. While inverted index is already used widely for full-text searching, we try to use generalized suffix tree for its ability to search for any substring within a document, not only exact word occurrence. Theoretically, the time and memory needed to index a collection of documents is linear in the total size of the documents. However, our implementation requires memory more than 1200 times of the size of documents. A further analysis shows that at least 32 times is needed, but will require longer indexing time. In conclusion, generalized suffix tree may not suitable for large amount of data. In the other hand, the search using generalized suffix tree is 3 times faster than inverted index. Suffix tree can be used only if substring search is required (e.g. DNA processing), or where time is significantly more important than memory (e.g. search autocomplete system). The access control itself acts as filter after the documents yielded from searching through the index.</p>",job satisfaction,0.0,,Center for Open Science,,posted-content

So Good It Has to Be True: Wishful Thinking in Theory of Mind,10.1162/opmi_a_00011,2017,Daniel Hawthorne-Madell; Noah D. Goodman,"<jats:p> In standard decision theory, rational agents are objective, keeping their beliefs independent from their desires. Such agents are the basis for current computational models of Theory of Mind (ToM), but the accuracy of these models are unknown. Do people really think that others do not let their desires color their beliefs? In two experiments we test whether people think that others engage in wishful thinking. We find that participants do think others believe that desirable events are more likely to happen, and that undesirable ones are less likely to happen. However, these beliefs are not well calibrated as people do not let their desires influence their beliefs in the task. Whether accurate or not, thinking that others wishfully think has consequences for reasoning about them. We find one such consequence—people learn more from an informant who thinks an event will happen despite wishing it was otherwise. People’s ToM therefore appears to be more nuanced than the current rational accounts in that it allows other’s desires to directly affect their subjective probability of an event. </jats:p>",job satisfaction,0.4,,MIT Press - Journals,Open Mind,journal-article

               <jats:p>Using next generation sequencing technology, characterise the true extent of bacterial contamination on mobile phones of hospital staff and determine the presence of multi-drug resistant bacteria associated with hospital acquired infections.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>DNA was extracted from the swab tips of 450 Particpant’s mobile phones. 16S rRNA primers were used to characterise and compare the microbiome on devices from the hospital staff and a control group. <jats:italic>Staphylococcus aureus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Enterococcus faecalis</jats:italic> underwent Kirby Baur disc diffusion.</jats:p>

Nonetheless, there can be challenges in being able to access this and pitfalls leading to negative experiences.

I joined my support group when I started to struggle with my PhD in 2021 despite my scepticism of the benefits and time ‘cost’. However, it has offered me the benefits of advice, reassurance, community and collaboration by the way in which it is run and how the members approach it.

So Good It Has to Be True: Wishful Thinking in Theory of Mind,10.1162/opmi_a_00011,2017,Daniel Hawthorne-Madell; Noah D. Goodman,"<jats:p> In standard decision theory, rational agents are objective, keeping their beliefs independent from their desires. Such agents are the basis for current computational models of Theory of Mind (ToM), but the accuracy of these models are unknown. Do people really think that others do not let their desires color their beliefs? In two experiments we test whether people think that others engage in wishful thinking. We find that participants do think others believe that desirable events are more likely to happen, and that undesirable ones are less likely to happen. However, these beliefs are not well calibrated as people do not let their desires influence their beliefs in the task. Whether accurate or not, thinking that others wishfully think has consequences for reasoning about them. We find one such consequence—people learn more from an informant who thinks an event will happen despite wishing it was otherwise. People’s ToM therefore appears to be more nuanced than the current rational accounts in that it allows other’s desires to directly affect their subjective probability of an event. </jats:p>",work performance,0.4,,MIT Press - Journals,Open Mind,journal-article

Mobile Phone Contamination in Clinical Environments ‘The True Extent’,10.1099/acmi.fis2019.po0001,2020,Rebecca Simmonds; Emma Hayhust,"<jats:p>Smart phones are integral , especially within healthcare. However, there are increasing concerns regarding their contamination and potential infection control risk. Bacteria under selective pressure can rapidly acquire resistant mechanisms leading to the assumption; mobile phones used within clinical environment may harbour bacteria associated with a higher infection mortality rate.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Using next generation sequencing technology, characterise the true extent of bacterial contamination on mobile phones of hospital staff and determine the presence of multi-drug resistant bacteria associated with hospital acquired infections.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>DNA was extracted from the swab tips of 450 Particpant’s mobile phones. 16S rRNA primers were used to characterise and compare the microbiome on devices from the hospital staff and a control group. <jats:italic>Staphylococcus aureus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Enterococcus faecalis</jats:italic> underwent Kirby Baur disc diffusion.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Results The microbiome revealed the extent of contamination far exceeds anything previously reported. In particular, gram-negative bacteria (including several important potential pathogens) were grossly under detected. 198 bacteria genus were discovered on mobile phones of which 34 were unique to the hospital. Differences were also detected between hospital departments. MRSA, VRSA and VRE were only detected within the hospital group.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Our results indicate traditional culture-dependent swabbing methods don’t provide an accurate account of mobile phone contamination. This may also be true in other areas relevant to infection control. Used within clinical environments could expose patients to unknown levels of multi drug resistant bacteria. Decontamination between patient contact should be a necessity to prevent the undermining of hand hygiene and the transmission of MDR bacteria.</jats:p>",work performance,1.0,,Microbiology Society,Access Microbiology,journal-article

However, when students can access quality support, these issues can be overcome (Naylor et al, 2018 : Elliot, 2020). Nonetheless, there can be challenges in being able to access this and pitfalls leading to negative experiences. In order to explore this, this essay will reflect on my own experiences of one type of support: informal PhD support groups. I joined my support group when I started to struggle with my PhD in 2021 despite my scepticism of the benefits and time ‘cost’. However, it has offered me the benefits of advice, reassurance, community and collaboration by the way in which it is run and how the members approach it. Thus, I have been converted from sceptic to true believer and I will conclude this essay by encouraging all fellow PhD students to give them a chance.

Being Underemployed is the True Test of Who You Really are - The Nexus of Underemployment and Employee Engagement:  Evidence from Sri Lanka,10.31357/icbm.v18.5844,0,N. Jasintha,"<jats:p>The current study intends to explore the nexus of underemployment and employee engagement among development officers in Sri Lanka. This study integrates the person-job fit theory with underemployment and employee engagement research. Employment possibilities exist for graduates in specific fields, but for a sizable number of graduates, finding a job has become the biggest challenge. As a result, improving graduate employability without having underemployment is a problem for the Sri Lankan university system. Expecting higher outcomes from underemployed employees has become pervasive by nature in Sri Lanka. Though previous studies paid attention to engagement level, little attention was paid to underemployment as an antecedent of employee engagement among the development officers, with the effect of age and gender as moderators. In addition to that, this study sheds new light on the underemployment level of development officers in Sri Lanka. A survey research strategy was used and data were collected from conveniently chosen 549 development officers working in the public sector. The Smart PLS 3.0 was utilised to analyse the data with a Multi group Analysis test to determine the age and gender effect on the nexus between underemployment and engagement. The results revealed that the individuals with the perception of underemployment are more likely to have lower employee engagement. No significant effects of age and gender were found in the nexus between underemployment and employee engagement. The study advances the boundaries of Human Resource Management literature while also providing helpful practical applications to the community. Policymakers can make more policies towards graduates to give them more proper job opportunities. This study can be done in a longitudinal way in order to identify the actual level of engagement throughout the period of time for a better understanding of development officers.&#x0D;

Mobile Phone Contamination in Clinical Environments ‘The True Extent’,10.1099/acmi.fis2019.po0001,2020,Rebecca Simmonds; Emma Hayhust,"<jats:p>Smart phones are integral , especially within healthcare. However, there are increasing concerns regarding their contamination and potential infection control risk. Bacteria under selective pressure can rapidly acquire resistant mechanisms leading to the assumption; mobile phones used within clinical environment may harbour bacteria associated with a higher infection mortality rate.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Using next generation sequencing technology, characterise the true extent of bacterial contamination on mobile phones of hospital staff and determine the presence of multi-drug resistant bacteria associated with hospital acquired infections.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>DNA was extracted from the swab tips of 450 Particpant’s mobile phones. 16S rRNA primers were used to characterise and compare the microbiome on devices from the hospital staff and a control group. <jats:italic>Staphylococcus aureus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Enterococcus faecalis</jats:italic> underwent Kirby Baur disc diffusion.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Results The microbiome revealed the extent of contamination far exceeds anything previously reported. In particular, gram-negative bacteria (including several important potential pathogens) were grossly under detected. 198 bacteria genus were discovered on mobile phones of which 34 were unique to the hospital. Differences were also detected between hospital departments. MRSA, VRSA and VRE were only detected within the hospital group.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Our results indicate traditional culture-dependent swabbing methods don’t provide an accurate account of mobile phone contamination. This may also be true in other areas relevant to infection control. Used within clinical environments could expose patients to unknown levels of multi drug resistant bacteria. Decontamination between patient contact should be a necessity to prevent the undermining of hand hygiene and the transmission of MDR bacteria.</jats:p>",employee engagement,1.0,,Microbiology Society,Access Microbiology,journal-article

Phd Support Groups: From Sceptic to True Believer,10.47967/tor2022/vol8.14,0,Kim Collet,"<jats:p>PhDs can be lonely and challenging endeavours; students come across setbacks, imposter syndrome sets in, motivation wanes and productivity slows (Denman et al, 2018 : Gin et al, 2021). However, when students can access quality support, these issues can be overcome (Naylor et al, 2018 : Elliot, 2020). Nonetheless, there can be challenges in being able to access this and pitfalls leading to negative experiences. In order to explore this, this essay will reflect on my own experiences of one type of support: informal PhD support groups. I joined my support group when I started to struggle with my PhD in 2021 despite my scepticism of the benefits and time ‘cost’. However, it has offered me the benefits of advice, reassurance, community and collaboration by the way in which it is run and how the members approach it. Thus, I have been converted from sceptic to true believer and I will conclude this essay by encouraging all fellow PhD students to give them a chance.

I describe several versions of linguistic alethic pluralism, alongside tests that natural language theorists use to identify different types of meaning variation.

The True Value of Open-Water Hydraulic Access Using Coiled Tubing,10.2118/199818-ms,2020,Mike Avery; Robert Greenaway; Robert Large; Phillip Rice,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>As the global well base continues to increase, it is becoming apparent that under-investment in maintenance has helped contribute to a decreasing average production per subsea well. To combat this trend, more focused and cost-effective intervention techniques have emerged such as open-water hydraulic access (OWHA) using coiled tubing (CT).</jats:p>
               <jats:p>OWHA using CT provides operators with a fit-for-purpose solution to deliver fluids to a subsea well without the requirement for mechanical intervention. In scenarios which meet the requirements outlined within this paper, OWHA using CT offers an attractive alternative to conventional intervention approaches.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Three predominant configurations of OWHA CT systems are apparent, all developed around differing drivers: a conventional system using a CT injector head (IH), a specialized system using a CT IH, and a powered reeler with deployment sheave. Both the benefits and limitations of each are considered to guide the reader in selecting the correct configuration for their application.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>The primary cost driver for hydraulic intervention is vessel selection. Factors including regional availability, mobilization requirements, and specification are key to the selection process. An advantage of OWHA using CT is the ability to use a vessel of opportunity due to the decreased equipment footprint and specification; this directly enhances service flexibility and cost management.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>When compared to alternative oil sources, the comparative cost per barrel of oil unlocked by OHWA is at least 43% less than the closest alternative. When compared to alternative intervention approaches, the simplified equipment and requirements result in a reduced total cost thus enhanced return on investment with accelerated payback.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Using average global vessel rates and generalized assumptions, for a single well intervention the total costs can be in the order of the following magnitudes: floating rig USD 9-16M, light well USD 6-10M, OWHA USD 2-5M. Using an average well production gain of 1,950 BOPD this gives a typical payback time period of ~9 months for a rig and ~3 months for OWHA.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>In scenarios which meet the requirements outlined within this paper, OWHA provides the most economical solution with the ability to provide positive returns in the same financial year.</jats:p>",employee turnover,1.0,https://onepetro.org/SPECTWI/proceedings-pdf/doi/10.2118/199818-MS/2353856/spe-199818-ms.pdf,SPE,SPE/ICoTA Well Intervention Conference and Exhibition,proceedings-article
Is Knowledge Justified True Belief?,10.31219/osf.io/yev3s,0,John Turri,"<p>Is knowledge justified true belief? Most philosophers believe that the answer is clearly ‘no’, as demonstrated by Gettier cases. But Gettier cases don’t obviously refute the traditional view that knowledge is justified true belief (JTB). There are ways of resisting Gettier cases, at least one of which is partly successful. Nevertheless, when properly understood, Gettier cases point to a flaw in JTB, though it takes some work to appreciate just what it is. The nature of the flaw helps us better understand the nature of knowledge and epistemic justification. I propose a crucial improvement to the traditional view, relying on an intuitive and independently plausible metaphysical distinction pertaining to the manifestation of intellectual powers, which supplements the traditional components of justification, truth and belief.</p>",employee turnover,0.0,,Center for Open Science,,posted-content

Giun’s <i>Verse Comments and Capping Phrases</i>,10.1093/oso/9780190941345.003.0003,2020,Steven Heine,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>This chapter provides a complete translation of Giun’s verse comments on the Treasury of the True Dharma Eye along with the original kanbun (Sino-Japanese) text composed in the fourteenth century, including the four-line verses and capping phrases written by Giun and those by Honkō from the eighteenth century. In addition, the preface by Giun is included. A complete list of the fascicles with the translation, romanization, and original characters is also presented. The chapter additionally features the author’s own interpretative remarks concerning Giun’s medieval commentary by highlighting the meaning and significance of each of the 60 fascicles and discussing the symbolism and ramification of key examples of Giun’s and Honkō’s poetic imagery. Reading through these materials highlights various literary motifs and religious themes that characterize the verse comments.</jats:p>",employee turnover,1.0,,Oxford University PressNew York,Flowers Blooming on a Withered Tree,book-chapter

Mobile Phone Contamination in Clinical Environments ‘The True Extent’,10.1099/acmi.fis2019.po0001,2020,Rebecca Simmonds; Emma Hayhust,"<jats:p>Smart phones are integral , especially within healthcare. However, there are increasing concerns regarding their contamination and potential infection control risk. Bacteria under selective pressure can rapidly acquire resistant mechanisms leading to the assumption; mobile phones used within clinical environment may harbour bacteria associated with a higher infection mortality rate.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Using next generation sequencing technology, characterise the true extent of bacterial contamination on mobile phones of hospital staff and determine the presence of multi-drug resistant bacteria associated with hospital acquired infections.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>DNA was extracted from the swab tips of 450 Particpant’s mobile phones. 16S rRNA primers were used to characterise and compare the microbiome on devices from the hospital staff and a control group. <jats:italic>Staphylococcus aureus</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Enterococcus faecalis</jats:italic> underwent Kirby Baur disc diffusion.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Results The microbiome revealed the extent of contamination far exceeds anything previously reported. In particular, gram-negative bacteria (including several important potential pathogens) were grossly under detected. 198 bacteria genus were discovered on mobile phones of which 34 were unique to the hospital. Differences were also detected between hospital departments. MRSA, VRSA and VRE were only detected within the hospital group.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Our results indicate traditional culture-dependent swabbing methods don’t provide an accurate account of mobile phone contamination. This may also be true in other areas relevant to infection control. Used within clinical environments could expose patients to unknown levels of multi drug resistant bacteria. Decontamination between patient contact should be a necessity to prevent the undermining of hand hygiene and the transmission of MDR bacteria.</jats:p>",employee turnover,1.0,,Microbiology Society,Access Microbiology,journal-article

Phd Support Groups: From Sceptic to True Believer,10.47967/tor2022/vol8.14,0,Kim Collet,"<jats:p>PhDs can be lonely and challenging endeavours; students come across setbacks, imposter syndrome sets in, motivation wanes and productivity slows (Denman et al, 2018 : Gin et al, 2021). However, when students can access quality support, these issues can be overcome (Naylor et al, 2018 : Elliot, 2020). Nonetheless, there can be challenges in being able to access this and pitfalls leading to negative experiences. In order to explore this, this essay will reflect on my own experiences of one type of support: informal PhD support groups. I joined my support group when I started to struggle with my PhD in 2021 despite my scepticism of the benefits and time ‘cost’. However, it has offered me the benefits of advice, reassurance, community and collaboration by the way in which it is run and how the members approach it. Thus, I have been converted from sceptic to true believer and I will conclude this essay by encouraging all fellow PhD students to give them a chance.
