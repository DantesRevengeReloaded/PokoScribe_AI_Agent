The article "What We Know About Leadership" by Robert Hogan and Robert B. Kaiser explores the relationship between personality, leadership, and organizational effectiveness. It emphasizes three main points: 

1. **Importance of Leadership**: Leadership is presented as a critical factor in organizational success, influencing team performance and employee well-being. Effective leadership contributes positively to the psychological and financial health of organizations, while poor leadership can lead to significant suffering and dysfunction within teams.

2. **Focus on Team Performance**: Leadership should be understood in terms of its impact on teams and organizations rather than merely individual leaders. Good leadership facilitates collective effort and is essential for a group's survival and effectiveness.

3. **Predictive Role of Personality**: Personality traits significantly influence leadership style and effectiveness. The authors argue that understanding these traits can aid in selecting future leaders and improving the performance of current ones. The article outlines a domain model of competencies, categorizing skills into four areas: intrapersonal, interpersonal, business, and leadership skills.

The authors critique the existing leadership literature, distinguishing between the popular "troubadour tradition" (which lacks empirical support) and the more rigorous "academic tradition" that provides reliable data but often fails to present a cohesive understanding of leadership. They propose that effective leadership is characterized by specific competencies, such as integrity, decisiveness, competence, and vision, which are crucial for motivating and guiding teams.

Additionally, the article discusses the prevalence of managerial incompetence, attributing it to undesirable personality traits rather than a lack of skills. It concludes that leadership significantly affects organizational effectiveness by influencing team dynamics, employee satisfaction, and overall performance. Ultimately, the article posits that addressing leadership quality is vital for improving organizational outcomes.

In "What We Know About Leadership," Robert Hogan and Robert B. Kaiser review the empirical literature on leadership, personality, and organizational effectiveness, presenting three main arguments. Firstly, they assert that leadership is a critical phenomenon with significant consequences for organizational success and individual well-being. Effective leadership enhances team performance and overall quality of life, while poor leadership can lead to widespread suffering, exemplified by the historical case of Sierra Leone's dictator, Foday Sankoh.

Secondly, the authors emphasize that leadership involves the ability to organize collective efforts for the common good, a skill rooted in our evolutionary history as social beings. They argue that effective leadership requires building and maintaining high-performing teams and that personality plays a vital role in determining leadership style.

Lastly, Hogan and Kaiser contend that personality traits can predict leadership effectiveness, suggesting that understanding these traits can enhance leader selection and development. They differentiate between "bright side" traits, which reflect positive social impressions, and "dark side" traits, which can lead to managerial incompetence over time. 

The article concludes that effective leadership is essential for organizational effectiveness, highlighting the importance of selecting leaders based on personality assessments and competencies that foster team performance and morale.

The article "What We Know About Leadership" by Robert Hogan and Robert B. Kaiser provides a comprehensive examination of the empirical literature surrounding leadership, personality, and organizational effectiveness. The authors present three central theses: first, that leadership is a significant and impactful phenomenon, arguably the most critical issue within the human sciences; second, that effective leadership is essential for the performance and well-being of teams and organizations; and third, that personality traits are predictive of leadership effectiveness, suggesting that understanding these traits can enhance leader selection and development.

Hogan and Kaiser argue that leadership fundamentally concerns organizing collective efforts to achieve common goals, making it vital for organizational success. They illustrate the detrimental effects of poor leadership through historical examples, notably highlighting the case of Foday Sankoh, a dictator whose leadership resulted in immense suffering in Sierra Leone. The authors categorize the existing literature on leadership into two main traditions: the troubadour tradition, which is largely anecdotal and lacks empirical backing, and the academic tradition, which is grounded in research yet often fragmented and incomplete.

The article further explores the relationship between personality traits and leadership effectiveness, emphasizing the importance of both the "bright side" (positive traits) and the "dark side" (negative traits) of personality. Hogan and Kaiser suggest that effective leaders exhibit competencies across four domains: intrapersonal skills, interpersonal skills, business skills, and leadership skills. They also discuss the significant impact of leadership on organizational effectiveness, noting that competent leaders can enhance employee satisfaction and overall organizational performance.

In conclusion, the authors assert that the interplay between leader personality, team dynamics, and organizational outcomes is crucial for understanding and improving leadership practices. They advocate for better selection tools to identify potential leaders and emphasize the importance of developing leadership competencies.

The article "What We Know About Leadership" by Robert Hogan and Robert B. Kaiser provides a critical review of existing literature on leadership, emphasizing three main points. First, leadership is presented as a vital and influential phenomenon in human sciences, crucial for the success of teams and organizations. Effective leadership is essential for organizational effectiveness, enhancing the well-being of employees and citizens, while poor leadership can lead to significant suffering and dysfunction within organizations. The authors illustrate this point through historical examples, including the destructive leadership of Foday Sankoh in Sierra Leone.

Second, the authors argue that leadership fundamentally revolves around team performance. They posit that good leadership facilitates collaboration and collective effort, which is necessary for achieving common goals. The third point asserts that personality traits are predictive of leadership effectiveness. The authors suggest that understanding the personality dimensions of potential leaders can guide organizations in selecting future leaders and enhancing the performance of current ones.

The article also critiques the existing leadership literature, categorizing it into two traditions: the "troubadour tradition," which lacks empirical support, and the "academic tradition," which is often decontextualized. Hogan and Kaiser contend that leadership should be evaluated based on team performance rather than merely positional authority or influence within a group. They propose a competency model detailing the essential skills for effective leadership, which includes interpersonal, business, and leadership skills, alongside a focus on personality traits.

In summary, Hogan and Kaiser’s work underscores the significance of leadership in organizational contexts, the need for effective personality assessments, and the importance of aligning leadership practices with empirical evidence to foster better organizational outcomes.

The article "What We Know About Leadership" by Robert Hogan and Robert B. Kaiser provides a comprehensive review of the empirical literature surrounding leadership, emphasizing three critical points. First, leadership is identified as a significant and impactful phenomenon in human sciences, essential for the success of organizations and the well-being of individuals. Second, effective leadership is closely linked to the performance of teams, groups, and organizations, where good leadership fosters positive outcomes, whereas poor leadership can lead to detrimental effects on the quality of life. Third, the authors argue that personality traits are predictive of leadership capabilities, suggesting that understanding these traits can aid in selecting and developing future leaders.

Hogan and Kaiser contrast two primary perspectives on historical leadership: one that emphasizes social forces and situational factors, and another that highlights the role of individual characteristics and actions. They propose that effective leadership is a skill rooted in one's capacity to build and maintain effective teams. The article advances a competency model that categorizes leadership skills into four domains: intrapersonal, interpersonal, business, and leadership skills, with an emphasis on the developmental aspect of these competencies.

The authors further explore the relationship between personality traits—using the five-factor model—and leadership effectiveness, presenting evidence that personality significantly influences leadership styles and organizational performance. They conclude by discussing the implications of managerial incompetence, suggesting that many organizational failures stem from poor leadership choices, driven by personality flaws that can be difficult to detect.

In summary, this article highlights the complex interplay between leadership, personality, and organizational effectiveness, advocating for a deeper understanding of these dynamics to improve leadership selection and training processes.
