The article "What We Know About Leadership" by Robert Hogan and Robert B. Kaiser explores the relationship between personality, leadership, and organizational effectiveness. It emphasizes three main points: 

1. **Importance of Leadership**: Leadership is presented as a critical factor in organizational success, influencing team performance and employee well-being. Effective leadership contributes positively to the psychological and financial health of organizations, while poor leadership can lead to significant suffering and dysfunction within teams.

2. **Focus on Team Performance**: Leadership should be understood in terms of its impact on teams and organizations rather than merely individual leaders. Good leadership facilitates collective effort and is essential for a group's survival and effectiveness.

3. **Predictive Role of Personality**: Personality traits significantly influence leadership style and effectiveness. The authors argue that understanding these traits can aid in selecting future leaders and improving the performance of current ones. The article outlines a domain model of competencies, categorizing skills into four areas: intrapersonal, interpersonal, business, and leadership skills.

The authors critique the existing leadership literature, distinguishing between the popular "troubadour tradition" (which lacks empirical support) and the more rigorous "academic tradition" that provides reliable data but often fails to present a cohesive understanding of leadership. They propose that effective leadership is characterized by specific competencies, such as integrity, decisiveness, competence, and vision, which are crucial for motivating and guiding teams.

Additionally, the article discusses the prevalence of managerial incompetence, attributing it to undesirable personality traits rather than a lack of skills. It concludes that leadership significantly affects organizational effectiveness by influencing team dynamics, employee satisfaction, and overall performance. Ultimately, the article posits that addressing leadership quality is vital for improving organizational outcomes.

In "What We Know About Leadership," Robert Hogan and Robert B. Kaiser review the empirical literature on leadership, personality, and organizational effectiveness, presenting three main arguments. Firstly, they assert that leadership is a critical phenomenon with significant consequences for organizational success and individual well-being. Effective leadership enhances team performance and overall quality of life, while poor leadership can lead to widespread suffering, exemplified by the historical case of Sierra Leone's dictator, Foday Sankoh.

Secondly, the authors emphasize that leadership involves the ability to organize collective efforts for the common good, a skill rooted in our evolutionary history as social beings. They argue that effective leadership requires building and maintaining high-performing teams and that personality plays a vital role in determining leadership style.

Lastly, Hogan and Kaiser contend that personality traits can predict leadership effectiveness, suggesting that understanding these traits can enhance leader selection and development. They differentiate between "bright side" traits, which reflect positive social impressions, and "dark side" traits, which can lead to managerial incompetence over time. 

The article concludes that effective leadership is essential for organizational effectiveness, highlighting the importance of selecting leaders based on personality assessments and competencies that foster team performance and morale.
