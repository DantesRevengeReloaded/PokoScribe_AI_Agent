Summary of /mnt/cf36a2d7-ecf4-46c7-a76a-5defe1ad7659/project_diplo_maria/1 RESEARCH/ACADEMIA/test/The effects of organizational learning environment factors on e-learning acceptance.pdf:
The article "The Effects of Organizational Learning Environment Factors on E-Learning Acceptance" by Cheng et al. (2012) investigates how various factors within the workplace influence employees' motivation to accept and utilize e-learning systems. The authors highlight the significance of workplace learning as a means for employees to develop professionally. E-learning is increasingly recognized for its efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and ability to support both formal and informal learning.

The study identifies three key organizational learning environment factors: managerial support, job support, and organizational support. The research applies the expectancy theory of training motivation and elements from technology acceptance models to formulate a conceptual model. This model suggests that the perceived support from management and the work environment can significantly impact employees' perceptions of the usefulness of e-learning systems, which in turn influences their intention to use these systems.

Using Structural Equation Modeling, the study found that perceived managerial support and job support positively affect employees' perception of the e-learning system's usefulness for individual learning. Conversely, organizational support positively affects perceived usefulness for social learning. Notably, the study also discovered that perceived usefulness for individual learning completely mediates the influence of environmental factors on the intention to use e-learning, while perceived usefulness for social learning only partially mediates this relationship.

Furthermore, the results indicate that perceived job support moderates the relationship between perceived usefulness and intention to use, but in an unexpected direction, suggesting a potential resistance to change among employees. This finding underscores the complexities involved in implementing e-learning systems in organizations.

The implications of this study emphasize the need for organizations to foster a conducive environment that supports e-learning initiatives and enhances employee engagement in continuous learning. By addressing the identified factors, organizations can enhance the acceptance and effectiveness of e-learning systems.

Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of workplace e-learning acceptance by integrating organizational factors into existing models of technology use, providing a foundation for future studies in this area.

Summary of /mnt/cf36a2d7-ecf4-46c7-a76a-5defe1ad7659/project_diplo_maria/1 RESEARCH/ACADEMIA/test/Successful lean implementation-Organizational culture.pdf:
The academic article titled "Successful lean implementation: Organizational culture and soft lean practices" by Bortolotti et al. (2015) explores the relationship between organizational culture (OC) and the successful implementation of lean management (LM) practices in manufacturing settings. The authors argue that while technical aspects of LM are important, a conducive OC characterized by specific dimensions significantly contributes to the success of LM initiatives.

The research reveals that successful lean plants exhibit a particular OC profile, which includes higher levels of institutional collectivism, future orientation, and humane orientation, alongside lower levels of assertiveness. These OC traits facilitate collaboration, long-term planning, and a positive work environment conducive to continuous improvement. Conversely, plants that fail to implement LM effectively tend to lack these cultural characteristics.

Summary of /mnt/cf36a2d7-ecf4-46c7-a76a-5defe1ad7659/project_diplo_maria/1 RESEARCH/ACADEMIA/test/A product model based approach.pdf:
The article by Sharon and Dori presents a project-product model-based approach to planning work breakdown structures (WBS) in complex system projects. It identifies the importance of integrating the project and system facets, emphasizing that successful project management requires a clear relationship between the architecture of products, their development processes, and organizational structures. The methodology proposed is based on the Project-Product Life Cycle Management (PPLM) model, which combines project management tools with product-related information, leading to a more reliable project plan that minimizes rework and corrective actions.

The authors critique traditional WBS methods, noting that they often lack explicit representation of the product aspect, which is crucial for accurate planning and risk management. They introduce two fundamental concepts: the Generic Project Construct (GPC), which incorporates product facets into project planning, and the System Build (SB), which allows for the modeling of various project-product configurations throughout the project life cycle.

The PPLM framework is supported by Object-Process Methodology (OPM), which facilitates a holistic view of project activities and product structures. This integration aids in better understanding dependencies between project processes and deliverables, thereby enhancing risk mitigation strategies.

The paper concludes by advocating for the use of the GPC, SB approach, and Object WBS (OWBS) views as valuable tools for stakeholders involved in project planning and execution. These tools provide clarity on deliverables and their interdependencies, enabling project managers to focus on achieving outcomes rather than merely completing processes.

In light of digital transformation and the growing prevalence of e-learning jobs, the study's findings underscore the importance of adapting project management methodologies to accommodate the complexities of modern, technology-driven projects.
