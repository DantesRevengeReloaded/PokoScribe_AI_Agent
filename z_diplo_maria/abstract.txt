**Abstract**

The pervasive integration of digital technologies has fundamentally reshaped the business landscape, compelling organizations to embark on digital transformation initiatives to stay competitive and fulfill evolving customer expectations (Hess, 2022). Effective project management is critical in navigating these complex transformations, ensuring alignment with strategic goals, optimizing resource utilization, and mitigating associated risks (Leong et al., 2023). This paper explores various project management methodologies—including traditional, agile, and hybrid approaches—in the context of digital transformation, highlighting the organizational, technological, and human resource challenges encountered. Additionally, the role of e-learning platforms in enhancing employee development within digital transformations is examined, emphasizing their benefits such as flexibility and cost-effectiveness, alongside potential risks like low engagement and cybersecurity threats. Case studies illustrate both successful and unsuccessful implementations, providing valuable insights into best practices. Strategic alignment, leadership support, and robust technological infrastructure are identified as pivotal factors for successful digital transformation and e-learning initiatives.
