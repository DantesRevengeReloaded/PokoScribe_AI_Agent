The article "Disruptive Innovation: An Intellectual History and Directions for Future Research" by Christensen et al. (2018) explores the concept of disruptive innovation, which has been widely adopted by practitioners but often misunderstood. The authors argue that while the foundational research has been frequently cited, empirical engagement with its core principles has been inconsistent. The paper aims to clarify the theory's intellectual evolution, moving from a descriptive framework centered on technology change to a more comprehensive causal theory of innovation and competitive response.

Key findings include:

1. **Intellectual History**: The theory's origins are traced from initial observations in industries like disk drives, where incumbents often failed to recognize disruptive threats due to prioritizing sustaining innovations that cater to their existing customers. This behavior results in the emergence of new entrants that target overlooked market segments.

2. **Anomalies and Refinements**: The authors emphasize the importance of "anomaly-seeking" research that has refined the theory over time. Notable refinements include recognizing that disruptive innovations can occur in new markets as well as established ones, and the understanding that no technology is inherently disruptive; the context and market positioning define its disruptiveness.

3. **Response Strategies**: The paper proposes future research directions focused on response strategies, performance trajectories, and innovation metrics. It identifies that incumbents can adopt a range of strategies—such as creating autonomous units for disruptive innovations, investing in existing capabilities, or using organizational ambidexterity—to successfully navigate disruptive changes.

4. **Impact of Metrics**: The authors discuss how the metrics used by firms to evaluate success can inadvertently bias them towards sustaining innovations, making them vulnerable to disruption. They advocate for a re-evaluation of these metrics to better accommodate disruptive opportunities.

5. **Project Management and E-Learning Contexts**: Although not the primary focus, the discussion touches on how these principles apply to modern contexts like e-learning and project management, where rapid digital transformation introduces both risks and opportunities in job markets.

The article concludes by advocating for a renewed scholarly focus on disruptive innovation theory, emphasizing the need for empirical research to explore the dynamics of disruption in various industries and contexts, including the intersection with digital transformation and project management.

The article by Brunetti et al. (2020) explores the challenges of digital transformation facing the Tyrol-Veneto macro-region, focusing on how various stakeholders—companies, public administrators, and educational institutions—can effectively address these challenges through a multi-stakeholder approach. The authors conducted qualitative research, including interviews with 60 stakeholders, to identify strategic actions categorized into three main pillars: culture and skills, infrastructures and technologies, and ecosystems.

1. **Digital Transformation Challenges**: The study highlights three primary challenges stemming from digital transformation:
   - The need for developing and updating digital skills across various sectors.
   - Continuous adaptation to new digital technologies, necessitating cutting-edge infrastructures.
   - The establishment of medium- to long-term synergies among stakeholders to foster innovative technological solutions.

2. **Benefits and Factors of E-Learning**: The findings emphasize the importance of digital education and lifelong learning programs. Specifically, they advocate for promoting digital literacy from early education and enhancing the skills of current employees to meet the demands of an evolving digital landscape. They also suggest investing in e-learning platforms to facilitate access to training.

3. **Digital Ecosystems**: The authors argue that fostering a collaborative environment among stakeholders is essential for effective digital transformation. Partnerships among companies, educational institutions, and public entities can drive innovation and ensure that the macro-region remains competitive.

4. **Project Management Theory**: The study underscores the significance of strategic planning and cooperation among stakeholders, aligning with project management principles that advocate for a systematic approach to addressing complex challenges.

In conclusion, Brunetti et al. (2020) propose that macro-regional policies for digital transformation should focus on developing a culture of digital skills, enhancing infrastructures, and building collaborative ecosystems to effectively leverage the opportunities presented by digitalisation.
