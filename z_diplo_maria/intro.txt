**Introduction**

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, the pervasive integration of digital technologies across virtually all sectors has fundamentally reshaped the business environment. Organizations are compelled to embark on digital transformation initiatives to remain competitive and meet the escalating expectations of their customers (Hess, 2022). Digital transformation encompasses the comprehensive incorporation of digital technologies into every facet of an organization, resulting in profound changes in operations, value delivery, and organizational culture. Successfully navigating this complex transformation requires more than merely adopting new technologies; it necessitates addressing numerous challenges through effective project management to align initiatives with strategic goals, optimize resource utilization, and mitigate associated risks (Leong et al., 2023).

A critical component of digital transformation is the implementation of e-learning platforms within businesses. As digital transformation projects are inherently multifaceted, impacting processes, technologies, and people, effective project management provides the essential structure and oversight needed to manage these intricate changes (Hess, 2022). E-learning serves as a strategic tool for continuous employee development, ensuring that the workforce acquires the necessary digital skills to adapt to technological advancements and shifting market demands (Dohe & Pike, 2018). The utilization of various project management methodologies, including traditional, agile, and hybrid approaches, plays a pivotal role in the successful deployment of e-learning initiatives. These methodologies facilitate collaboration among cross-functional teams, ensure alignment with organizational objectives, prioritize training efforts, and maintain quality standards throughout the project lifecycle (Azenha et al., 2021).

Despite the significant benefits, the implementation of e-learning within digital transformation projects presents unique challenges. Organizational resistance to change, technological compatibility issues, skill gaps among employees, and cybersecurity concerns are among the primary obstacles that businesses must overcome (Trenerry et al., 2021; Mican et al., 2021). Additionally, the rapid pace of technological innovation can render e-learning solutions obsolete if they are not continuously updated and adapted to emerging trends (Hess, 2022). Addressing these challenges requires a strategic approach that includes fostering a culture of innovation, investing in employee training, enhancing technological infrastructure, and employing robust risk management practices (Leong et al., 2023).

This paper aims to explore the role of e-learning in business digital transformation, examining the various project management methodologies employed, the benefits realized, and the challenges encountered. By synthesizing insights from recent scholarly articles, this study seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of how effective project management can enhance the success of e-learning initiatives, thereby contributing to the overall digital transformation efforts of organizations. The discussion will also highlight strategies to mitigate risks and overcome barriers, ensuring that e-learning serves as a sustainable and impactful component of business innovation and competitiveness.
