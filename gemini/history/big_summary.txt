This article argues that leadership is crucial for organizational success and human well-being.  Effective leadership improves team performance, while bad leadership has devastating consequences. The authors propose that leadership is about building and maintaining effective teams, persuading individuals to work towards a common goal.  They argue that a leader's personality ("who we are") directly impacts their leadership style ("how we lead"), and that personality can be used to select and develop leaders.  The article reviews existing competency models, suggesting a four-domain framework (intrapersonal, interpersonal, business, and leadership skills), and highlights the importance of integrity, decisiveness, competence, and vision in leaders.  Research shows a strong correlation between personality traits and leadership effectiveness.  The authors also discuss the negative impact of "dark side" personality traits on leadership, arguing that these traits can lead to managerial incompetence and organizational failure.  Finally, they propose a five-component model for organizational effectiveness: talented and motivated personnel, a strong management team, an effective strategy, and robust monitoring systems, all ultimately driven by good leadership.
