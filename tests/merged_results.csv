"The Relationship Between Employee Engagement, Job Satisfaction, And Employee Performance in The Federal Government",,2022.0,"Shellow, Alexis L","Leaders in the U.S. Federal Government face performance challenges due to disengaged employees and employees with low satisfaction. Leaders within the federal government need to understand the relationship between employee engagement, job satisfaction, and employee performance, as decreased employee performance can result in decreased productivity, increased turnover, and have negative financial implications. Grounded in Herzberg’s two-factor theory and Kahn’s engagement theory, the purpose of this quantitative correlational ex post facto study was to examine the relationship between employee engagement, job satisfaction, and employee performance within the federal government. Data from the 2019 Federal Employment Viewpoint Survey (n = 100) were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. The multiple linear regression analysis results indicated the model was able to significantly predict performance F(2,97) = 43.836, p \u3c .001, R2 = .475. Employee engagement (t = 3.594, p \u3c .001, β = .504) was the only statistically significant predictor. A key recommendation for leaders in the federal government to engage federal employees is to recognize employee achievements, create a work environment promoting psychological safety, provide employees with adequate resources, and have well-defined roles and responsibilities for employees while allowing them to exercise autonomy in their work processes. The implications for positive social change include the potential for cost savings, helping leaders in the federal government assess areas of improvement, creating a more productive environment for improved employee performance, and increasing employee retention and job satisfaction in the workforce",,18.4,https://core.ac.uk/download/580005621.pdf,'IUScholarWorks',,,0

have been severely impacted. These industries were hit harder than others, resulting in a significant
drop in employee numbers and a significant increase in the number of people on temporary leave.
As a result, the impact of the pandemic on the motivation, job satisfaction, and employee
engagement of Ghanaian hospitality and tourism workers was investigated in this study. The
study's goal was to answer the following research questions: i) Does employee motivation predict
job satisfaction? (ii) Does employee engagement predict job satisfaction? (iii) Does employee
engagement predict job satisfaction? (iv) Does motivation act as a mediating variable in the direct
relations between employee engagement and job satisfaction? Participants ranged in age from 18
to 60 years old and came from various backgrounds. With the help of a third variable, employee
engagement, the collected data was analyzed using mediation analysis in the statistical software
Jeffery's Amazing Statistical Program (JASP) to determine the relationship between employee
motivation and job satisfaction. Employee motivation and job satisfaction were found to have a
significant positive relationship, implying that higher employee motivation is associated with
higher job satisfaction. When controlling for the effects of job motivation on job satisfaction and
employee engagement on job satisfaction, there was also a significant positive relationship between employee motivation and employee engagement. Again, there was a significant positive
relationship between employee engagement and job satisfaction. The study's findings supported
the hypothesis and answered the research question established in the thesis paper. These findings

This study explores the relationship between motivation, job satisfaction, and employee performance, with employee engagement as a mediator. Specifically, the research focuses on Information Technology (IT) companies in Kosovo and various locations across the European Union involved in different projects. The sample for this study comprises 112 respondents selected through convenient sampling. The research model is analyzed using Partial Least Square (PLS) analysis with SmartPLS 3.0 software. The empirical findings indicate that motivation positively influences employees’ engagement and performance in various IT positions. However, job satisfaction has no direct impact or exerts a relatively low influence. Nonetheless, employee engagement significantly enhances employee performance by mediating the effects of motivation and job satisfaction. The research findings have significant managerial implications, emphasizing the importance of actively promoting motivation, innovation, and job satisfaction to increase employee involvement and achieve desired outcomes",,10.6,https://core.ac.uk/download/618257252.pdf,MISC,,,0
Social Security Administration Employee Lived Experiences of Job Satisfaction and Employee Turnover,,2018.0,"Cain, Lafaun","Employee turnover continues to be an issue in federal organizations, including the Social Security Administration (SSA). While issues such as retiring baby boomers and budget constraints are beyond the control of any agency, retaining employees is critical to maintain essential services. The purpose of this transcendental phenomenological study was to explore SSA employee\u27s lived experiences of job satisfaction and employee turnover to uncover motivators and satisfaction strategies. The conceptual framework for the study was based on Maslow\u27s human needs and Herzberg\u27s two-factor theory. Data were collected from 20 SSA frontline employees using 6 open-ended interview questions. The data were analyzed using a modification of van Kaam\u27s method of analysis of phenomenological data and NVivo 11 Pro. Study results revealed that time, stress, pay and benefits, public service, and interoffice relationships were the prime intrinsic and extrinsic factors participants perceived as directly related to their job satisfaction. They highly valued job enrichment programs, cohesive teams, and pay and benefits, which override daily stressors inherent to the public demands strategies for the agency. Conducting the study in depressed socioeconomic areas might also provide significant insights, particularly since stress and workload were essential dissatisfiers. SSA provides critical services to many vulnerable groups. Strategies that employees perceive as motivating enhance the quality of services and benefits to eligible American citizens, many of whom rely on these services for quality of life, thereby reducing the burden of local communities to support these individuals if SSA services fail",,10.6,https://core.ac.uk/download/217229186.pdf,'IUScholarWorks',,,0

The impact of employee engagement on organizational productivity: case study of UVS.,,2017.0,"Moletsane, Malesedi Ruth.","Masters Degree. University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban.There is no evidence that links employee engagement to high productivity in the sugar
industry. Low levels of engagement have been observed in the South African manufacturing
industry. The objective of this study was to establish the factors that influence employee
engagement at Umhlathuze Valley Sugar (UVS) and to ascertain the impact of the
relationship between employee engagement and productivity, to highlight areas of focus to
UVS for a sustainable future. A quantitative study was done with a random sampling design
used to explore the impact of employee engagement on productivity. The sample group (N=
73) was made up of female and male UVS staff. The employee engagement questionnaire
that was used looked at different facets of employee engagement, these were; employee
commitment towards their work, internal communication and how leadership style affects
their engagement levels, employee well-being and how person job-fit influenced employee
engagement. The organizational productivity questionnaire used also looked at various
facets, which included; employee punctuality, commitment of employees to produce high
quality work and meet deadlines, employee absenteeism and minimisation of waste to
improve productivity. The study used descriptive statistics to analyse the data. The findings
from the study indicate that UVS has a sufficiently engaged workforce, but there is a
significant room for improvement. The participants also revealed an awareness of the impact
of their engagement levels towards company productivity. However, in terms of job
satisfaction and employee well-being, UVS employees are dissatisfied with their
compensation packages and the lack of support in as far as work conditions are concerned.
Employee motivation directed towards improving employee contribution towards
productivity, HR policies aimed at creating an inclusive workplace as well as strategies of
improving workplace conditions, are some of the recommendations from this study. Finally,
the study recommends that similar research be conducted to include the entire sugar

"EFFECT OF MONETARY INCENTIVES ON PERFORMANCE OF SMALL

AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES IN KENYA:

A CASE STUDY OF GRAPHIC LINEUPS LIMITED",,,"MUHUMED, AHMED DEKA","The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of monetary incentives on

Performance of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Kenya. The specific objectives

of the study were to: identify effect of job satisfaction on performance of SMEs, examine

the effect of employee motivation on performance of SMEs, determine the effect of

employee engagement on performance of SMEs, identify the effect of turnover on

performance of SMEs and examine the effect of employee commitment on performance

of SMEs. Research questions were developed from the specific objectives of the study.

Scope and significance were set from the research questions. Findings of this study will

introduce new comparative knowledge for the effect of monetary incentives on

Performance of SMEs in Kenya. Review of related theoretical literature provided the

theoretical rationale of the problem under study, while variables were deciphered from

analysis of empirical literature. Observed research gaps were used to develop the

appropriate conceptual framework. Descriptive research design was used in setting the

methodology for the research. Target population was 65 respondents, which formed the

sample size as census approach was adopted. Data was collected through questionnaires

and interviews, was analyzed using SPSS using both descriptive and inferential analysis.

Results were presented in tables, graphs and charts. Findings indicate that job

satisfaction has no statistically significant effect on performance of SMEs. Results

indicate that financial incentives did not lead to job satisfaction and job satisfaction has

no effect on performance of SMEs. Results also indicate that employee motivation has

statistically significant effect on performance of SMEs. Results further indicate that

employee engagement has statistically significant effect on performance of SMEs.

Results indicate that employee turnover has statistically significant effect on performance

of SMEs. Results indicate that employee commitment has statistically insignificant effect

on performance of SMEs. The study concludes job satisfaction does not lead to enhanced

employee performance therefore offering financial incentive may not improve employee

performance. Monetary incentives lead to enhanced motivation which leads to increased

employee performance. Monetary incentives lead to employee’s engagement which leads

to higher employee performance. Incentives reduce staff turnover in the organization

which enhances overall job performance. Monetary incentives do very little in ensuring

employees commitment and therefore may not lead to enhanced employee performance.

The study recommends that organizations should put measures in place to ensure job

satisfaction through attractive monetary incentives. The organization should motivate

employees as a priority through reasonable monetary incentives. Incentives should aim at

ensuring that the employees are more engaged in organization activities and thereby

promote productivity. The organization should use monetary incentives to improve

satisfaction and reduce the employee’s turnover. Incentives should be aimed at keeping

employees committed to organization goals and objectives",,10.0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/224836840.pdf,,,,0

An investigation of employee engagement and business outcomes at an engineering services firm,,2012.0,"Gill, Preetinder Singh","This research study investigated the constructs and dimensions of employee engagement and their relationship with business outcome data from 2009 to 2011 at a mid-sized engineering services firm and two of its business units. Employee engagement ratios, as defined by Crabtree (2004), for all entities studied were below that associated with world-class organizations. Survey items related to salary and compensation received low scores from both engaged and disengaged employees. Kruskal-Wallis’s median comparison tests revealed that many survey items varied over the period of three years for each entity studied. A factor analysis of companywide survey data yielded 5 dimensions of employee engagement, which was consistent with existing literature of Cummings and Worley (2008), Richman (2006), Shaw (2005), and Robinson et al. (2004). Structural equation modeling revealed that the dimension of communication has a causal relationship with the dimension of management effectiveness, which, in turn, has causal relationships with dimensions of 1) salary and compensation, 2) opportunity for development and recognition, and 3) alignment with the organization. A single variable linear regression analysis between average ratings of every survey item and every selected business outcome showed that a significant relationship existed between several pairs of variables for each entity studied. However, many of these pairs were found to be inversely proportional. This finding, subject to limitations and assumptions of this study, is inconsistent with the findings of Harter et al. (2009) and Buckingham and Coffman (1999).
The study uncovered many areas of improvement and elucidated several solutions aimed at enhancing employee engagement at the engineering services firm. New possible v relationships between employee engagement and business outcomes are also presented. These possible relationships in turn serve as an impetus for future research. Additional research work is needed to understand intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence and promote employee engagement at services firms.

The results came from a multiple regression analysis that indicated a significant negative relationship between job satisfaction and participation in the employer-sponsored wellness program (Î² = -.22, t = -2.24, p = .027), where faculty who were not participating in the wellness program had higher levels of job satisfaction (M = 3.62) in comparison to those who did participate (M = 3.80). Interaction analyses indicated a relationship between gender and job satisfaction (Î² = -.26, t = -2.70, p = .008). Females were more likely than were males to have higher levels of job satisfaction, as well as years of experience and job satisfaction. Faculty who had been employed for between 11 and 15 years were more likely to have higher levels of job satisfaction. Job satisfaction appear lower for those who participate in employer-sponsored wellness programs because of the personal gratification employees\u27 experience. The findings may contribute to social change with information that leaders could use to reduce absenteeism, increase productivity, and profitability",,9.2,https://core.ac.uk/download/147834938.pdf,'IUScholarWorks',,,0
Hotel Managers\u27 Motivational Strategies for Enhancing Employee Performance,,2016.0,"Barbosa-McCoy, Vanessa Lizzette","More than 600,000 employees depart the hospitality industry for a variety of reasons such as lack of motivational strategies (MS) of hotel general managers (GMs). The purpose of this multiple case study using census sampling was to explore what MS hotel GMs used to enhance employee performance. The 3 GMs of 3 full-service branded hotels with a guest capacity of 160-699 were randomly selected in South Florida. Data were collected from face-to-face interviews with the hotel GMs, employee performance evaluations, and results of guest and employee satisfaction surveys from the hotel GMs. Data analysis involved methodological triangulation to determine how motivation was captured and measured using interpreted data, verification through the member-checking process, and coding techniques such as mind mapping to identify reoccurring codes and categories. Through thematic analysis, 4 major themes emerged: workplace motivation, job satisfaction, positive performance, and social expectation. Findings from the 4 themes revealed that recognition and guest satisfaction unveiled a positive effect on employee performances and that motivation through community engagement gave employees reasons to perform well. The effectiveness of MS on employee performance was conceptualized by the expectancy theory to determine motivational triggers and the behavior engineering model to determine which MS led to improved performance. Social implications include encouraging hotel GMs to adjust and develop motivational strategies that engage employees to improve the employee-customer relationship and to increase community involvement which may promote positive social change",,9.2,https://core.ac.uk/download/147834805.pdf,'IUScholarWorks',,,0
Moderating Effect of Within-team Trust on Employee Engagement and Workgroup Outcomes,,2014.0,"Anderson, Scott J.","Abstract: This study explored daily variability of employee engagement. The study used daily measures of hindrance demands, challenge demands, and employee engagement to examine the relationship between these constructs as well as for their influence on outcomes of job satisfaction, productivity, and safety for workgroup members. Additionally, I explored high-involvement management as an antecedent of employee engagement. The main area of interest was evaluating the influence of within-team trust as a potential modifier of the relationship between employee engagement and job satisfaction, safety, and productivity. While not a consistent occurrence across all days of the survey period in this study, there were days when a statistically significant conditional indirect effect was found in the relationship between employee engagement and job satisfaction when within-team trust was incorporated as a modifier in the model. This influence was observed on Day 1 for the indirect path of hindrance demands through employee engagement to job satisfaction and on both Day 3 and Day 4 for the indirect path of high-involvement management through employee engagement to job satisfaction. This implies that the potential role of within-team trust as a modifier of an employee's level of engagement on employee perception measures such as job satisfaction.Business Administratio",,9.0,https://core.ac.uk/download/215309238.pdf,'Oklahoma State University Library',,,0
An empirical study on factors influencing level of employee engagement with reference to select organization,10.26643/gis.v14i4.5341,0.0,Dr. Srikrishna Gade; Lavanya. K,"<jats:p>There is no exact definition for the term Employee engagement yet. The term Employee engagement means that the employee feel the belongingness towards the organization always strives to the growth of their organization. An Engaged employee means one who fully enthusiastic about their work and takes positive action for organizations reputation and interests. Employee engagement first appeared as a concept in management theory in 1990s. Employee engagement practices are well established in the management of human resources. &#x0D;
An organization with high employee engagement might have higher productivity than the organizations having less employee engagement level employees. Whereas employee engagement is directly proportional to the organizations productivity as higher the engagement level of employee results higher efficiency and productivity. Also the employee engagement may directly or indirectly relate to the job satisfaction or morale of employee. By understanding the importance of employee engagement many organizations are doing engagement practices such as providing great work place culture, employee development programs to enhance the engagement level of employee to raise productivity and daily performances. </jats:p>",employee engagement,9.0,https://journals.eduindex.org/index.php/gis/article/download/5341/2597,Edupedia Publications,GIS Business,journal-article,0

This study employed regression modeling on online survey collected data. Findings/Results: Research has demonstrated that human resource management (HRM) practices, including job security, empowerment, training, and quality of work life, have a substantial influence on employee retention rates. Furthermore, job satisfaction emerges as another critical determinant of the duration employees choose to stay with their present employer.Conclusions: Furthermore, the results of the regression analysis indicate that there is a direct link between HRM practices and employee retention. However, this connection is significantly stronger when job satisfaction levels are initially increased. As a result, effective HRM practices have been shown to enhance employee satisfaction, leading to greater loyalty and commitment to the company.Originality/value (state of the art): This study aims to enhance our understanding of the relationships between human resource management (HRM) practices, employee satisfaction, and employee retention. While previous research on the connection between HRM practices and employee satisfaction is limited, this study is noteworthy for exploring the effects of four dimensions of HRM practices on employee satisfaction, and how this in turn impacts employee retention.

This entails exploring the various factors that significantly impact employee satisfaction within an organization, with the goal of identifying key drivers that have a profound effect on the morale and motivation of the workforce. By understanding these crucial factors, organizations can employ diverse strategies to enhance employee performance, thereby maximizing both individual and organizational objectives.
In today\u27s competitive market landscape, human resources are undeniably a critical asset for any organization. With intense competition, businesses are relentlessly striving to enhance customer satisfaction to gain a competitive edge. The utilization of human resources has a direct and substantial impact not only on customer satisfaction but also on gaining a competitive advantage. Consequently, it is imperative for managers to consistently assess employee satisfaction and pay close attention to the variables that exert significant influence on both employee satisfaction and performance. To investigate employee satisfaction and its ramifications on employee performance, this study employs a survey method. The utilization of an experimental approach is deemed unnecessary for this research, as employee satisfaction primarily involves theoretical aspects, making experimental methodologies redundant. Data for this research was collected through questionnaires, constituting primary data, targeting managers at various organizational levels within the private sector.
The analysis of the gathered data reveals a robust positive correlation between employee satisfaction and employee performance. Notably, the variables most closely associated with employee satisfaction, and subsequently, with a significant impact on employee performance, are employee creativity and reduced absenteeism. Consequently, it can be confidently asserted that there exists a strong, positive relationship between employee satisfaction, employee performance, and the attainment of organizational goals",,8.6,https://core.ac.uk/download/597862401.pdf,Stallion Publication,,,0

Methodology: The population of this study was the educational staff at the University of X. The sampling technique used in this study was stratified random sampling, involving a total of 50 educational staff as samples. Data collection was done using a performance scale, job satisfaction scale, and transformational leadership scale. The data were analyzed using the path regression ordinary least square technique.
Main Findings: The results showed that transformational leadership has a significant effect on job satisfaction of educational staff, transformational leadership does not effect on performance of educational staff, job satisfaction has a significant effect on performance of educational staff and transformational leadership has a significant effect on performance through job satisfaction as a mediator of educational staff. Thus, job satisfaction can play a good role as a mediator.
Applications of this study: Satisfaction has an important role in increasing work productivity which includes quantity and quality of work, timeliness of work, work effectiveness, independence, and commitment. Leaders in implementing a transformational leadership style must be accompanied by efforts to create a work environment that supports the realization of the job satisfaction of its employees. Regardless of employee job satisfaction, the leader’s transformational leadership style will be in vain.
Novelty: To the best of our knowledge, research on job satisfaction as a mediating variable in the effect of transformational leadership on the performance of educational staff is still rarely done both in Indonesia and abroad. Previous studies only positioned job satisfaction as an independent variable that affects performance and not as a mediator variable. This study focuses on job satisfaction as a mediator the effect of transformational leadership on the performance of educational staff",,8.0,https://core.ac.uk/download/287179835.pdf,'GIAP Journals',,,0

job satisfaction as a mediator of the educational staff at the University of X Yogyakarta, and the direct effect of job 

satisfaction on the performance of educational staff at the University of X Yogyakarta.

Methodology: The population of this study was the educational staff at the University of X. The sampling technique 

used in this study was stratified random sampling, involving a total of 50 educational staff as samples. Data collection 

was done using a performance scale, job satisfaction scale, and transformational leadership scale. The data were 

analyzed using the path regression ordinary least square technique.

Main Findings: The results showed that transformational leadership has a significant effect on job satisfaction of 

educational staff, transformational leadership does not effect on performance of educational staff, job satisfaction has a 

significant effect on performance of educational staff and transformational leadership has a significant effect on 

performance through job satisfaction as a mediator of educational staff. Thus, job satisfaction can play a good role as a 

mediator.

Applications of this study: Satisfaction has an important role in increasing work productivity which includes quantity 

and quality of work, timeliness of work, work effectiveness, independence, and commitment. Leaders in implementing a 

transformational leadership style must be accompanied by efforts to create a work environment that supports the 

realization of the job satisfaction of its employees. Regardless of employee job satisfaction, the leader’s transformational 

leadership style will be in vain. 

Novelty: To the best of our knowledge, research on job satisfaction as a mediating variable in the effect of 

transformational leadership on the performance of educational staff is still rarely done both in Indonesia and abroad.

A Quantitative Examination of the Relationship between Perceived Burnout and Job Satisfaction in Certified Public Accountants,,2017.0,"Haddad, Tanya","Burnout in accounting is a significant problem that has numerous impacts on organizational effectiveness. Job burnout is the result of prolonged exposure to workload pressure and excessive job demands. As accounting professionals work in a fast-paced and regulated environment, it is important to better understand whether burnout is related to job dissatisfaction within the industry.

"Analysis of the Importance of Job Insecurity, Psychological Safety and Job Satisfaction in the CSR-Performance Link",10.3390/su12093514,0.0,Min-Jik Kim; Byung-Jik Kim,"<jats:p>Existing works on the association between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and performance have investigated how CSR affects external stakeholders (e.g., shareholders, customers, local communities, and environment). However, the effect of CSR on internal stakeholders such as employees who ultimately determine organizational performance is relatively underexplored. Institutional theory suggests that institutional enablers, e.g., CSR practices, influence macro-level variables, like organizational performance, via micro-level intermediating processes, such as perceptions, attitudes and behaviors of employees. Thus, this paper proposes that internal mechanisms are essential to explain the CSR-performance link. Using a 3-wave time-lagged survey data of 301 workers in South Korean firms (144 men and 157 women, average age: 40.30), this research examines how psychological safety and job satisfaction of an employee function as sequential mediators in the CSR-performance link. Moreover, the current research also investigates how job insecurity negatively moderates the link between CSR and psychological safety. The results demonstrated that psychological safety and job satisfaction function as sequential internal mediators in the link. In addition, job insecurity negatively moderated the influence of CSR on psychological safety. The results suggest that an employee’s perceptions and attitudes, such as job insecurity, psychological safety, and job satisfaction, significantly influence the relationship between CSR and performance.</jats:p>",job satisfaction,7.35,,MDPI AG,Sustainability,journal-article,35

A Contemporary Approach to Managing Social Responsibility in Relation to Employees as Perceived in Academic Papers,10.7160/eriesj.2020.130301,2020.0,"Jarkovská, Martina; Jarkovská, Petra","Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) plays a significant role in Human Resource Management (HRM), especially when it comes to stipulating desired employee performance or behaviour, such as work performance, job satisfaction, organizational commitment or retention. However, the academic literature offers very fragmented or partial answers to questions addressing this issue, as many scholars focus exclusively on e.g. one-country or one-industry based sample only. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to summarize the current ""state-of-the-art"" trends in academic literature and thereafter, based on the findings, propose a broader contemporary conceptual approach to managing CSR in relation to employees. The results suggest a positive causal relationship between CSR and desirable employee behaviour, with job satisfaction often playing the function of a mediator. The findings also suggest that adding CSR to HRM practices could improve employees' work attitudes. In doing so, full compatibility with other concepts and principles across the organization is a premise",,7.0,https://core.ac.uk/download/493038719.pdf,'Czech University of Life Sciences Prague',,,0

Building from tournament theory, in a field experiment of 267 employees across 22 units, we find improved performance from diagnostic feedback delivered under increasing pay dispersion; however, substantively different patterns emerge for criterion‐referenced feedback.

The mediating effect of employee engagement on leadership styles and organizational commitment in Telekom Malaysia call centre,,2021.0,"Shahida Syafiqah, Abdullah","Highly committed to company’s overall business mission is particularly important for call centre, since agents’ behaviour and attitude has a direct impact on customer service. In employer-employee relationship, leadership plays an important role in people management in which understanding the significance of committed agents with effective leadership style enhance the success of call centre operating in today’s competitive environment. Nonetheless, previous studies discovered inconsistent results in organisational commitment and leadership styles relationship, particularly, transformational and transactional leadership styles. These inconsistencies led to a new line of research that shows how important it is to look at the effect of employee engagement as a potential mediating variable that could explain the relationship. Therefore, the present study investigated the relationships between leadership styles and organizational commitment in Telekom Malaysia call centre. Drawing upon the social exchange theory, the study also examined the mediating effect of employee engagement on the relationships between transformational leadership, transactional leadership and organizational commitment. Quantitative research design was adopted to collect the data and answer the research questions. Using a questionnaire survey, a total of 262 responses were collected from agents located in Kuala Lumpur. The data was analysed using PLS-SEM. The findings revealed that transactional leadership and employee engagement had positive influence on call centre agents’ organizational commitment, whereas, transformational leadership portrayed positive influence on employee engagement, but had no influence on organizational commitment. Employee engagement mediated the relationship between transactional leadership style and organizational commitment partially since transactional leadership style has both direct and indirect impacts on organisational commitment. Meanwhile, employee engagement fully mediated the relationship between transformational leadership style and organizational commitment.

The importance of employee job satisfaction in the public sector,,2020.0,"Kedama, Nombuyiselo","The success of service delivery heavily relies on how satisfied employees are with their jobs, and how they are treated within the South African public sector. A number of deliberations can be described and linked to the importance of job satisfaction. Firstly, job satisfaction contributes to the mental health and general life satisfaction of employees. This may happen through acquiring self-esteem, which is a person's overall sense of self-worth and/or personal values. Organisations depend on the health, skills, knowledge, and ability of their human resources in order to stay abreast with technological developments and remain competent on the global stage as they pursue organisational goals and objectives. This dependence has given rise to the need to assess the importance of employee job satisfaction in the South African public sector. To that end, this study employed a desktop research method by reviewing journal articles, government gazettes, conference papers, and relevant books to gather data and conduct content analysis in order to establish facts about employee job satisfaction in the public sector. The study found that emotional, cognitive, and behavioural components make up job satisfaction. The feelings that an employee has regarding his or her job form the emotional component of job satisfaction n. In addition, boredom, anxiety, and excitement are the most common feelings experienced by employees when they perform their jobs. Actions such as coming late to work and pretending to be ill form the behavioural components and types of actions that employees display in relation to their levels of job satisfaction",,6.0,https://core.ac.uk/download/346403035.pdf,'Thamar University - Faculty of Arts',,,0

Strategies Hospitality Leaders Use to Reduce Employee Turnover,,2018.0,"Perev, Borislav","Employee turnover is a global problem with adverse effects on financial performance and sustainability of organizations. In the hospitality industry, employee turnover levels increased to 58.8%, and the associated cost of turnover may be more than 100% of an employee\u27s yearly wage, with a total loss of over $25 billion a year. The purpose of this single case study was to explore strategies used by hospitality leaders in the southeastern United States to reduce employee turnover. The conceptual framework was the transformational leadership theory. Purposeful selection of participants included leaders with experience in developing and implementing strategies for reducing employee turnover. Data collection included face-to-face semistructured interviews with 8 organizational leaders and a review of declassified organizational documents. Data analysis included inductive coding and calculation of code frequency. Results indicated 3 themes: effective hiring process reduced employee turnover, supportive leadership decreased employee turnover, and continuous training and development reduced employee turnover.

The Link Between Job Satisfaction and the Intention to Leave Among Casino Employees,,2017.0,"Aho, Oliver Wayne","Job turnover has long plagued the hospitality and tourism industry. The casino segment of this industry is particularly vulnerable to excessive staff turnover due to the face-toface interaction between gamblers and gaming company employees. The relationship between job satisfaction and job turnover has been explored in numerous industries. This research study used correlational research, linear regression, and descriptive statistics to examine the intrinsic, extrinsic, and general factors of job satisfaction and its influence on the intent to leave for all employees and the employees of the security, housekeeping, and beverage departments of a major casino operation. Additionally, the variables of age, gender, education, number of years employed by the casino, shift routinely worked, number of hours worked per week, and the department in which the employees worked were examined to determine their influence on job satisfaction and intent to leave for all casino employees and the employees of the security, housekeeping, and beverage departments. While a high degree of job satisfaction existed for many study respondents, a significant degree of job dissatisfaction existed overall and within those departments. Of the seven variables examined, age, shift, and hours worked were found to be significant negative factors and influenced the intent to leave for study respondents, while gender was a factor in the security, housekeeping, and beverage departments. Ten of the 49 departments examined reported lower scores for all three factors of job satisfaction and a higher score for intent to leave than the mean of all 50 departments. Finally, it was determined that more than one-fifth of the casino respondents suggested their intent to move to another department within the casino operation",,5.4,https://digitalcommons.georgefox.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&context=dbadmin,Digital Commons @ George Fox University,,,0
"Relationships Between Job Satisfaction, Supervisor Support, and Profitability Among Quick Service Industry Employees",,2017.0,"Vann, Joseph Carl","Low profit margins threaten the sustainability of quick service restaurants (QSRs). In the United States, low levels of employee job satisfaction and low employee perceptions of supervisor support decrease organizational profitability by as much as $151 million annually, depending on the size and type of organization. Guided by the 2-factor theory of motivation, the purpose of this correlational study was to examine the relationship between employee job satisfaction, employee perceptions of supervisor support, and organizational profitability. A convenience sample of employees from 86 QSR franchise locations in Houston, Texas completed the Job Satisfaction and Perceived Supervisor Support surveys. Multiple linear regression analysis and Bonferroni corrected significance calculation predicted organizational profitability (F(2, 71) = 9.20, p \u3c .001, R2 = .206) and employee job satisfaction (ï?¢ = .577, p = .025). The effect size indicated that the regression model accounted for approximately 21% of the variance in organizational profitability. Employee perceptions of supervisor support (ï?¢ = -.140, p = .580) did not relate to any significant variation in organizational profitability. The findings may be of value to QSR business professionals developing initiatives to improve organizational profitability. Improving employees\u27 perceptions of supervisor support to generate high levels of employee job satisfaction could affect behavioral social change to enhance the health and wellbeing of employees and the wealth and sustainability of QSR franchise locations",,5.4,https://core.ac.uk/download/147837485.pdf,'IUScholarWorks',,,0

Perpetuating this problem is that some auditing business owners do not know the relationship between internal auditors\u27 intrinsic job satisfaction, extrinsic job satisfaction, and auditors\u27 turnover intention. Grounded in Herzberg\u27s 2- factor theory, the purpose of this correlational study was to examine the relationship between intrinsic job satisfaction, extrinsic job satisfaction, and auditors\u27 turnover intention. Participants included 96 members of the Central Florida Institute of Internal Auditors. Data were collected using the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Michigan Organizational Assessment Questionnaire. Results of the multiple regression analysis indicated the model as a whole was able to significantly predict auditors\u27 turnover intentions, F(2, 93) = 47.635, p \u3c .001, R2 = .506. Extrinsic job satisfaction was the only significant predictor (t = -6.515, p \u3c .001). Implications for social change include the potential for leaders to better understand predictors of involuntary turnover and the potential to save money on recruitment and training. Business owners may become more profitable through better employee retention strategies; these findings may also add to the body of knowledge for stable employment opportunities.

Overqualification as Moderator for the Link Between Job Change and Job Satisfaction Among Immigrants and Natives in Germany,10.31235/osf.io/q7nu2,0.0,Samir Khalil; Almuth Lietz; Sabrina Jasmin Mayer,"<p>Job satisfaction is a major driver of an individual’s subjective well-beingand thus affects public health, societal prosperity, and organisations, asdissatisfied employees are less productive and more likely to change jobs.However, changing jobs does not necessarily lead to higher job satisfactionin the long run. Previous studies have shown, instead, that changingjobs only increases job satisfaction for a short period of time beforeit gradually falls back to similar levels as before. This phenomenon isknown as the ’honeymoon–hangover’ pattern. In our study, we identifyan important new moderator of the relation between job change and jobsatisfaction: the job–qualification match of job change. Based on relativedeprivation theory, we argue that a job change from being overqualified ina job lowers the likelihood of negative comparisons and thus increases thehoneymoon period and lessens the hangover period. In addition, we investigatewhether this moderating effect is less pronounced among immigrants,since the phenomenon of overqualification occurs more frequentlyamong immigrants. We use data from the Socio-Economic Panel rangingfrom 1994–2018 and focus specifically on individual periods of employeesbefore and after job changes (N=134,417). Our results confirm that achange to a job that requires a matched qualification has a stronger andlonger-lasting effect on job satisfaction, and that this effect is slightly lowerfor respondents born abroad.</p>",job satisfaction,5.02,,Center for Open Science,,posted-content,2

Human resource management practices and employee performance management in Nigerian higher educational institutions,,2014.0,"Nura, Abubakar Allumi","Previous studies on performance management system focus on one or two of its dimensions with little insight in the public sector, so also studies on human resource management practices did not attempt to use all the practices comprehensively. This study examined both individually and comprehensively the relationship between the six human resource management practices and all the four dimensions of performance management system among academics in higher educational institutions in Nigeria. The dimensions of performance management system as operationalized by this study are, organizational objective, individual objective, performance development and employee satisfaction. Human resource management practices also as operationalized by this study are procurement, development, compensation, integration, maintenance and separation. Furthermore, this study also investigated the mediating effects of employee behavior and information and communication technology (ICT) adoption on the relationship between human resource management practices and performance

management system among academics in higher educational institutions in Nigeria. Data was collected from five Federal universities in the North Western Nigeria using a cross sectional study design and multimode survey strategy. 800 questionnaires were distributed to the respondents who were sampled using a multi stage sampling technique. SmartPLS SEM was used in testing the study hypotheses. The results

obtained indicated that majority of the hypothesized relationships thirteen (13) out of

twenty (20) direct relationships were supported. Additionally, the results of the

mediation tests provided that five (5) mediating hypotheses out of twelve were

significant. The outcome of this study provides a very sound insight of the study on performance management system in the public sector particularly higher educational

institutions. It will also benefit the government, the policy makers and other

concerned agencies in Nigeria. More so, information and communication technology

and employee behaviors have been proven by this study as strategic tools that could be efficiently used by managers to effectively manage performance of their employees. This study encountered limitations such as inability to include other types of higher educational institutions like the polytechnics and colleges of education, unable to cover all the six regions in Nigeria instead focused on only one region the North West region",,5.0,https://core.ac.uk/download/268139918.pdf,,,,0

Work Performance of Print Media Employees: A Path Analysis using Organization and Psychological Behaviors,10.31235/osf.io/mfj8c,0.0,Rachel Advincula,"<p>This study determined the best fit model of work performance among print media employees in Region XI. In an attempt to answer the objective, a quantitative research method utilizing a descriptive-correlational research design was employed. The study was conducted in Region XI which is located at the Southeastern  part  of  Mindanao, Philippines. The employees of print media companies in Region XI were the respondents particularly those in printing press business industry that offers printing, publications, and adverting services. There were 419 employees of printing industry participated in the study. The study was employed the questionnaires adapted from different studies and to fit the context of the respondents of this study. The instrument was divided into four parts such as Innovative Work Behavior, Work Engagement, Organization learning and Work Performance. Results revealed that there is a significant relationship between innovative work behavior, organizational learning, work engagement and work performance of print media employees. Among the three independent variables, only the organizational learning and work engagement significantly predict employees work performance while the innovative work behavior does significantly predict employees work performance. Since organizational learning and work engagement were significant predictors of employees work performance, it is recommended that the management of print media will consider these variables in formulating training like advance multimedia, seminars on capacity building, and rewards and incentives program to improve employees work performance.</p>",work performance,5.0,,Center for Open Science,,posted-content,0
Effect of Psychological Contract on Employee Turnover Intention: Moderating Role of Select Demographic Variables,10.54517/esp.v9i5.1793,0.0,Neha Sharma; Sandeep Kaur,"<jats:p>Since the inception and the spread of COVID-19 from March 2020 in India, companies have experienced a rapid increase in the rate of unemployment as well as employee turnover intention. However, though employer appears to have additional power due to high unemployment levels, but it’s also been balanced by employees having new and more alternatives over whom they get employed due to extensive adoption of remote working by all the companies. Employees are highly satisfied at the workplace, prone to get retained with the organization, develop faith in the organizational system only if there is fulfillment of their psychological contract; employer’s showing concern for employees. This study aims to examine the relationship between psychological contract and employee turnover intention for the employees working in general insurance companies in India. The study further explores the moderating effect of select demographic variables for the relationship between psychological contract and employee turnover intention. These demographic variables are considered as independent groups and their moderation effect relationship between Psychological Contract and Employee Turnover Intention is tested with the help of SMART PLS software. The findings are insightful and will pave the way for the insurance companies to retain the employees by reducing their employee turnover intention and focusing on fulfillment of psychological contract.</jats:p>",employee turnover,5.0,https://esp.apacsci.com/index.php/esp/article/viewFile/1793/1221,Arts and Science Press Pte.

Turning Over Employee Turnover: A Review on Employee Alumni and Rehiring,10.31235/osf.io/xc3wp,0.0, Salehudin; Aryana Satrya,"<p>Purpose:This paper explores how organisations can cope with high employee turnover. This paper aims to highlight potential benefits of maintaining a network of employee alumni and rehiring former employees. Finally, this paper also introduces the concept of recoverability to define the potential of employee alumni to be rehired.Approach:This paper reviewed the latest literature on employee alumni and rehiring. This paper does not discuss the potential antecedents of employee turnover, instead focuses on a coping mechanism for the consequence. Findings:This paper challenges the assumption that former employees can no longer contribute to the organisation after their resignation. Additionally, this paper disputes the premise of employee turnover finality by exploring employee rehiring as a potential solution to recoup lost human capital. Finally, this paper identifies an apparent lack of human resources management literature on employee rehiring. Research Implication:This paper discusses scientific and practical implications and future research directions on employee alumni and rehiring. Originality:This paper highlights how organisations can cope with the high rate of employee turnover, instead of attempting to minimise it. This paper also extends the definition of functional turnover by introducing the potential of employee rehiring and recoverability of lost human capital.</p>",employee turnover,5.0,,Center for Open Science,,posted-content,0
The mediating effect of job satisfaction on the link between employees’ motivation and job performance,10.21203/rs.3.rs-2158214/v1,0.0,Berhanu Endeshaw,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
        <jats:p>The aim of the study was to examine the mediating effect of job satisfaction on the link between employees’ motivation and job performance. Stratified sampling in conjunction with simple random sampling techniques was employed to draw respondents from Tikur Anebessa Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Data processing used descriptive statistics, correlation and multiple regression with the help of SPSS and Amos 23 software. The result of the study found that the entire independent variables and mediator had positive relation and significant effect (i.e. explained by 53.4%) on job performance. The mediating variable (job satisfaction) has shown partially mediated the independent (employees’ motivation) and dependent variable (job performance). It is therefore recommended that motivation and job satisfaction should be taken into consideration to enhance employee job performance.</jats:p>",job satisfaction,5.0,,Research Square Platform LLC,,posted-content,0

"MODELLING THE LINK BETWEEN CONFLICT MANAGEMENT STYLES, ORGANISATIONAL TRUST AND EMPLOYEE JOB SATISFACTION",10.36713/epra15559,0.0, Talatu Raiya Umar;  Bashir Farouq Umar,"<jats:p>While past studies have established a significant and positive relationship between conflict management styles and employee job satisfaction. However, the fundamental interaction behind this link remain unclear. To address this gap, calls for further research has been suggested, particularly on the interactive process through which conflict management styles, specifically, collaborating, accommodating, compromising, avoiding and dominating styles were cast as the key dimensions of conflict management styles that are likely to influence employee job satisfaction. Hence, in the present study a structured questionnaire was used to collect data from Academic and Non-academic staff of some selected public tertiary institutions located in North-Central and North-Western parts of Nigeria. Partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was adopted to test the hypothesized research model. The quantitative results indicated that collaborating, dominating, avoiding and compromising conflict management styles were significantly and positively related to employee job satisfaction. On the contrary, accommodating style demonstrated no significant effect on employee job satisfaction. The results further showed that organisational trust moderated the relationship between collaborating, avoiding, and compromising styles and employee job satisfaction. But, no significant interaction effect was found between organisational trust and both dominating and accommodating styles. Implications of the results for future research and practice, as well as the limitations of the study are highlighted.

Strategies Middle Managers of Nonprofit Health Care Organizations Use to Motivate Their Administrative Workforce,,2019.0,"Elliott, Chastidy","Despite the awareness of employee motivation among scholars and business leaders, many American workers attest to being unmotivated. A lack of employee motivation can lead to negative business outcomes. Therefore, middle managers may experience challenges in identifying strategies to motivate their staff. Grounded in the path-goal theory, the purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore nonprofit health care organization middle managers\u27 motivational strategies for the administrative workforce. The participants were comprised of 13 middle managers in the United States who supervised administrative teams of 4 or more members for over 2 years and effectively implemented motivational strategies. The data collection methods were telephonic semistructured interviews and reflective journaling. Through thematic analysis, 3 themes emerged: utilization of various leadership behaviors, awareness of motivational factors, and employee performance. The implications for positive social change include the potential to stimulate personal drive, improve career development, and allow individuals the opportunity to increase the quality of their home lives and communities. By understanding effective motivational strategies, health care leaders may realize tactical solutions to business goals through the development of their managerial staff\u27s inspirational approaches",,4.8,https://core.ac.uk/download/289242377.pdf,'IUScholarWorks',,,0

Strategies for Retaining Employees in the Nonprofit Sector,,2018.0,"Parker, George","Voluntary employee turnover is a concern for nonprofit leaders due to human capital\u27s strategic role in achieving performance excellence. The consequences of volunteer turnover include loss of profitability, productivity, knowledge, and financial stability. The purpose of this single-case study was to explore strategies used by 3 leaders of a nonprofit organization in the Washington, DC, area who have experience with the nonprofit\u27s employee retention efforts. Data were collected from semistructured face-to-face interviews and organizational documentation and analyzed through the conceptual lens of Maslow\u27s hierarchy of needs theory. Data gathered from interviews and analyses of organizational data and performance outcomes were manually coded and thematically organized. The use of member checking the data and methodological triangulation increased the trustworthiness of data interpretation and the study. Three key themes emerged: (a) training and development, (b) advancement opportunities, and (c) strategic leadership. Through analysis of data collected for this study, nonprofit leaders can assess their employees\u27 development needs and provide training to support their growth. Nonprofit leaders may support their employees\u27 development by creating a career path by aligning tenure with advancement and formal training. Nonprofit leaders\u27 actions and decisions affect workforce commitment. Nonprofit employees are intrinsically motivated to create positive social change and make an impact on nonprofits\u27 stakeholders via programs and services. Nonprofit leaders can use this study to improve retention strategies, ensure their employees\u27 wellbeing, and contribute to positive social change by assisting employees in ensuring stakeholder wellbeing",,4.6,https://core.ac.uk/download/217227871.pdf,'IUScholarWorks',,,0

Raya,"<jats:p> The debate concerning the link between human resource management (HRM) and employee level as well as organizational outcomes has reached an interesting crossroads. While studies continue to demonstrate a relationship between financial success and the organization’s commitment to management practices that support people’s goals and treat people as assets, yet in reality, the focus on achieving short-term financial performance has obscured the consideration of people-oriented goals. Given the centrality of HRM practices to organizational success, this study reports the results of a survey conducted among 626 knowledge professionals working in IT companies in Chennai city of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The study found statistically significant relationship between HRM practices and employee-level outcomes such as perceived efficacy, engagement and employee well-being, where employee well-being plays a mediating role.

Does Participation Matter? Exploring the Role of Participation in Corporate Leadership Development Programs on the Intent to Stay of High-Potential Employees in the Biotech Industry,,2024.0,"Griffin, Glenna M.","The idea of leadership development programs for high-potential employees within organizations has long been a standard for driving employee retention within organizations. Yet, employee retention is different from employee intent to stay. Retention metrics measure historical data, looking back to determine how long an employee has stayed in the organization. Employee intent to stay measures, at that moment, data that contribute to an employee’s motivation to stay with the organization. Employers spend significant budgets on leadership development programs for high-potential employees and report on that participation in company retention metrics. Does the investment in these programs also support an employee’s internal motivation to stay with the company, or are these programs better categorized as a development tool? Understanding the factors that compel employees to stay with the organization would reduce turnover and retraining costs by a significant margin. The aim of this bounded case study was to determine the factors of intent to stay for employees working in the biotechnology industry within the United States. Eight interviews were conducted with employees in the biotechnology industry, including four participants in leadership development programs and four non-participants in a leadership development program. Three themes emerged that drive overall employee intent to stay: positive employee experience, significant employee engagement, and a supportive employee ecosystem.

"Relationship Between Job Performance, Compensation, and Turnover Intention in the Retail Industry",,2022.0,"Sewell, Donald Lynn","Employee turnover intention can lead to voluntary employee turnover, costing retail organizations millions of dollars annually. Retail business leaders who fail to address voluntary turnover intention face increased voluntary employee turnover and reduced operational performance. Grounded in equity theory, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between employee job performance, employee compensation, and voluntary turnover intention in the retail industry. Data were collected from 76 Texas retail store management employees using the Self-Rated Job Performance Survey, Compensation Survey, and Modified Turnover Intention Scale. The results of the multiple linear regression were significant, F (2, 73) = 4.43, p = .01, R² = .11, indicating that job performance and compensation explained 11% of the variance in turnover intention. Only job performance (β = .26, t = 2.39, p = .02) made a unique contribution to the model. A key recommendation is for business leaders to focus on retaining highly productive employees using nonmonetary incentives, including more paid time off, greater scheduling flexibility, and better healthcare options. The implications for positive social change include the potential to decrease unemployment and increase tax revenues, which may contribute to higher household incomes, standards of living, and tax revenues for social programs, benefiting residents in local communities",,3.4,https://core.ac.uk/download/580005619.pdf,'IUScholarWorks',,,0

Employee turnover in manufacturing SMEs in Japan: an analysis of the link with HRM practices,10.4038/suslj.v13i1.7668,0.0,Aruna S. Gamage,"<jats:p>Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector is playing a significant role in Japanese economy. However, over the last two decades, SMEs have no longer been a thriving source of growth. The firm entry rate has downward trend while exit rate has trended upward in recent years and considerably exceeded the entry rate. One of the reasons for the high rate of business failures in SMEs, is due to its less attention to the human side of their businesses when compared with their counter parts of large enterprises. High voluntary turnover is considered to be the one of critical problem for SME owner/managers among many other human resource issues. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between Human Resource Management (HRM) practices and voluntary turnover in SMEs in Japan. Specifically, this study attempts to examine the relationship between HRM practices and voluntary turnover shedding some lights on the mediating effect of the link in between HRM practices and turnover rate. A structured questionnaire was developed and sent to 436 SMEs in Aichi Prefecture and 144 firms responded to the questionnaire resulting in 32 percent response rate. Based on the data analysis it was found that there is negative but weak relationship, partially mediated by HR outcomes, between HRM practices and voluntary turnover rate in manufacturing SMEs in Japan.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.4038/suslj.v13i1.7668Sabaragamuwa University Journal 2014; V. 13 No. 1 pp 17-31</jats:p>",employee turnover,3.14,https://account.suslj.sljol.info/index.php/sljo-j-suj/article/download/7668/5835,Sri Lanka Journals Online (JOL),Sabaragamuwa University Journal,journal-article,14

Professional Satisfaction as a Key Factor in Employee Retention: A case of the Service Sector,10.29036/jots.v11i20.123,0.0,Yeliz Pekerşen; Onur Tugay,"<jats:p>The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between the reasons for workers employed in catering and kitchen departments leaving their jobs and their job satisfaction. In accordance with this purpose, data were collected by a convenience sampling method with 244 employees between 10.04.2019-24.04.2019 including food and beverage and kitchen departments in the three, four, and five-star hotels operating in Eskişehir. According to the data obtained, it is concluded that the majority of the hotel employees consider the fact that the wages paid in the enterprises are not satisfactory and that there is not a significant relationship between the reasons for hotel employees' ceasing of employment and their occupational satisfaction levels. It can be stated that employees have a great role in increasing the rate of profit, which is the main purpose of the hotel enterprises, to run the business smoothly, and to ensure customer satisfaction and loyalty. Therefore, it is an important issue to focus on meeting the professional satisfaction levels of the employees and determining the possible factors that may lead to ceasing employment.</jats:p>",employee satisfaction,2.1,https://jots.cz/index.php/JoTS/article/download/123/73,University College of Business in Prague,Journal of Tourism and Services,journal-article,10

A New Type of Standardized Statistical Work,10.23943/princeton/9780691179476.003.0002,2020.0,Arunabh Ghosh,"<p>This chapter explores early statistical work in the People's Republic of China's (PRC) Northeast, arguing that this work and the practical experience so gained was the foundation upon which the rest of the country's statistical apparatus was based. Unpacking the constituent elements of Wang Sihua's “new type of standardized statistical work” permits an articulation of the ways in which this new type of statistics was regarded as more standardized, correct, and scientific than what preceded it in the years before 1949. The chapter shows that the 1950s were shot through with the influence, rarely pedagogical or technical in nature but rather all-pervasive and methodological, of what by 1959 would come to be termed the Maoist model of ascertaining fact. This Maoist model, with its emphases on direct experience over technical knowledge and on ideological fervor as a source of expertise, rendered the earlier binary and the clean solutions it offered much more conflicted. As a result, statisticians and statistical workers throughout the 1950s found themselves not only transitioning from a “nonsocialist” to a “socialist” system of data collection and analysis but also operating in a milieu that particularly valued personal, individual, practical experience.</p>",work performance,1.0,,Princeton University Press,Making It Count,book-chapter,0

Organizational Commitment and Employees' Performance Ratings: Both Type of Commitment and Type of Performance Count,10.2466/pr0.1994.75.3f.1539,1994.0,Harold L. Angle; Marian B. Lawson,"<jats:p> This study, conducted in a Fortune 500 manufacturing organization, examined the relationship between employees' commitment and performance. Several months after 85 employees' affective and continuance commitment had been measured, their global job performance and four specific performance facets were rated by their supervisors. Affective commitment was related to two performance facets but was unrelated to the other two facets. Continuance commitment was unrelated to any of the performance facets. Neither type of commitment was related to global performance. Results were interpreted as suggesting that the link between organizational commitment and performance may depend on the extent to which motivation rather than ability underlies performance. These results, consistent with motivational frameworks offered by Vroom in 1964 and Katz and Kahn in 1978, also supported the distinction between affective and continuance commitment suggested by Meyer and Allen in 1991. </jats:p>",organizational performance,0.37,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2466/pr0.1994.75.3f.1539,SAGE Publications,Psychological Reports,journal-article,37

Such analyses have mainly been based upon hyperlink counts, the number of hyperlinks between a pair of websites, although some have used title mentions or <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">URL</jats:styled-content> citations instead. The ability to automatically gather hyperlink counts from <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">Y</jats:styled-content>ahoo! ceased in <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">A</jats:styled-content>pril 2011 and the ability to manually gather such counts was due to cease by early 2012, creating a need for alternatives. This article assesses <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">URL</jats:styled-content> citations and title mentions as possible replacements for hyperlinks in both binary and weighted direct link and co‐inlink network diagrams. It also assesses three different types of data for the network connections: hit count estimates, counts of matching <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">URLs</jats:styled-content>, and filtered counts of matching <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">URLs</jats:styled-content>. Results from analyses of <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">U.S.</jats:styled-content> library and information science departments and <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">U.K.</jats:styled-content> universities give evidence that metrics based upon <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">URLs</jats:styled-content> or titles can be appropriate replacements for metrics based upon hyperlinks for both binary and weighted networks, although filtered counts of matching <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">URLs</jats:styled-content> are necessary to give the best results for co‐title mention and <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">co‐URL</jats:styled-content> citation network diagrams.</jats:p>",workplace psychology,0.19,,Wiley,Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,journal-article,19
A comparison of link and URL citation counting,10.1108/00012531111148985,2011.0,Mike Thelwall,"<jats:sec><jats:title content-type=""abstract-heading"">Purpose</jats:title><jats:p>Link analysis is an established topic within webometrics. It normally uses counts of links between sets of web sites or to sets of web sites.

Measuring metacognitive performance: type 1 performance dependence and test-retest reliability [now published in Neuroscience of Consciousness],10.31234/osf.io/jrkzm,0.0,Matthias Guggenmos,"<p>Research on metacognition − thinking about thinking − has grown rapidly and fostered our understanding of human cognition in healthy individuals and clinical populations. Of central importance is the concept of metacognitive performance, which characterizes the capacity of an individual to estimate and report the accuracy of primary (type 1) cognitive processes or actions ensuing from these processes. Arguably one of the biggest challenges for measures of metacognitive performance is their dependency on objective type 1 performance, although more recent methods aim to address this issue. In the present work we scrutinize the most popular metacognitive performance measures in terms of their validity (independence of type 1 performance) and test-retest reliability. Based on data of the Confidence Database we find that no current metacognitive performance measure is independent of type 1 performance. The shape of this dependency is reproduced by a simple computational model which considers metacognitive noise in addition to sensory noise. Moreover, we show that the reliability of metacognitive performance measures is highly sensitive to the combination of type 1 performance and trial number. Critically, trial numbers frequently employed in metacognition research are too low to achieve an acceptable level of test-retest reliability. Finally, we investigate design choices and analytical remedies to improve both validity and reliability and provide general recommendations for studies investigating metacognitive performance.</p>",employee performance,0.01,,Center for Open Science,,posted-content,1

Some students are more equal: Performance in Author Recognition Test and Title Recognition Test modulated by print exposure and academic background,10.3758/s13428-023-02330-y,0.0,Marion Hug; Julian Jarosch; Christiane Eichenauer; Selina Pennella; Franziska Kretzschmar; Pascal Nicklas,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Reading is a key skill for university students. The Author Recognition Test (ART) and the Title Recognition Test (TRT) have both been used for decades to measure print exposure which correlates with reading and other linguistic skills. Given the available evidence for interindividual differences in reading skills, this study addresses three open issues. First, to what extent do ART and TRT scores correlate with individual differences regarding students’ study programs? Second, how do these results correlate with the self-reported time spent reading different types of text genres (e.g., fiction, nonfiction) per week? And third, this study compares ART and TRT to one another. We tested students from six study programs in the humanities and (medical) sciences which vary in the amount and kind of reading material required for study success. We found that students perform significantly differently in the ART and the TRT depending on their field of study. Students in a study program focusing on fiction and literature perform best overall. We also replicated the well-known effect of age on ART and TRT scores: older students have better scores. We did not find reliable effects of reading time on test performance, whereas individual creative writing habits did positively predict ART/TRT test results. These results raise a number of important questions regarding the ART/TRT in general and regarding interindividual differences in personal reading and writing habits and the change in reading habits in times of media convergence.</jats:p>",employee performance,0.0,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/s13428-023-02330-y.pdf,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Behavior Research Methods,journal-article,0

Citizen Engagement in Print Media,10.59677/njlc.v16i2.59,0.0,Alexandra Tjiramanga,"<jats:p>This paper explores the content and communication acts of text messages in the form of SMSes written by Namibian citizens and published daily under “What you’re Saying!” in The Namibian. Its main aim is to provide insights into the realities of the population at grassroot-level, which are brought to light via the medium of the newspaper. Using the theoretical framework of Medium theory and theory of Cultural Hegemony, this paper argues that citizen engagement via SMS discloses how  public communication contributes to press freedom, problem solving and nation-building in Namibia. The “What you’re saying” platform enables alternative and activist citizen participation in the discussion of their choice. This study used 286 SMSes to identify areas of concern of Namibian citizens. The study’s objectives were to presents issues, such as eduation, health, or service delivery  directed to entities in the public and private sector, Further objectives include sub-themes, and communication acts, such as criticism, information-giving, complaint, suggestion, question, request, review and praise. The analysis discusses frequency of keywords in relation to the themes and sub-themes used. The findings are related to services and governance. Another feedback mechanism might be required to show responses to legitimate concerns.</jats:p>",employee engagement,0.0,http://journals.nust.na/index.php/njlc/article/download/59/22,Namibia University of Science and Technology,NAWA Journal of Language and Communication,journal-article,0
"Climate Concern and Engagement: Large Face-to-Face and Online Polls by the Dutch non-profit Milieudefensie (post-print, published article)",10.31234/osf.io/8xb92,0.0,Anna Bosshard; Cameron Brick; Anne Chatrou,"<p>Climate change mitigation depends on tracking public opinion across populations. Social scientists can collaborate with environmental organizations that conduct surveys among their audiences. We teamed up with the non-profit Milieudefensie, who surveyed Dutch attitudes towards climate change in 2019–2020. The large dataset had face-to-face (n= 3,102) and online interviews (n = 30,311) of urbanity, climate concern, policy preferences, interviewer-rated engagement with climate change, and behavior (whether the interviewee provided their email and phone number to the organization). To reveal the representativeness of these kinds of convenience samples, we tested whether attitudes and their associations with behaviors were similar to previous studies. Climate concern, preference for climate policy, and interviewer-rated engagement were high. In the online survey, 47% of respondents signed up for an email newsletter, and 7% provided their phone number. Higher climate concern and preference for climate policy predicted interviewer-rated engagement and behavior (weak to strong associations). Urbanity was not related to concern, policy preferences, or interviewer-rated engagement. Policy preferences did not differ between the face-to-face and online samples. The results provide convergent evidence to conventional online surveys. These Dutch residents appear slightly more engaged with systemic change to mitigate climate change than the general public.</p>",employee engagement,0.0,,Center for Open Science,,posted-content,0
The Pastor as Vital Link : a Study in How Seminary-Educated Pastors Engender Engagement with Scripture in Select Congregations,10.32597/dissertations/528/,0.0, ;  ; Jewel Longenecker,"<jats:p>Problem. The problem this study sought to address was the tendency of “ordinary readers” of Scripture to misuse the Bible on the one hand, or to give up reading it entirely, on the other hand. The purpose of this study was to develop a grounded theory that describes how seminary-educated pastors are successfully leading ordinary readers to informed, enthusiastic engagement with the Bible. The conceptual lenses through which research data were compared to literature in the field included teaching methodologies proposed by Wink, Blair, and Borsch.  Method. The study used a qualitative research design. It was field focused, utilized the “self” as the research instrument, used interpretation, employed expressive and first- person language and voice, and paid attention to particulars. The study offers a grounded theory that describes how seminary-educated pastors are successfully leading ordinary readers to informed, enthusiastic engagement with the Bible. The grounded theory grew out of interviews with six pastors who were chosen purposively. Pastors were chosen who (a) regularly lead adult Bible studies in their congregations; (b) are consciously utilizing tools of biblical interpretation gleaned in seminary as they prepare for and teach adult Bible studies; (c) perceive that congregational members who participate in these Bible studies are enthusiastically engaged with Scripture; and (d) perceive that congregational members who participate in these Bible studies are making use of tools of biblical interpretation. In addition, the grounded theory reflects interviews with participants in the studies these pastors are leading.  Results. Five major themes emerged from interviews with pastors: (a) their formative experiences with the Bible; (b) their passion for biblical formation; (c) their understanding of pastoral identity as it relates to Bible teaching; (d) their pedagogical approach; and (e) personal characteristics that support their Bible teaching. Although pastors came from diverse backgrounds and ministry settings, their experiences, perspectives and behaviors share a great deal in common. While pastors do not share a teaching technique in common, they do share an overall pedagogical approach in common, and they share much more in common than a pedagogical approach. This is particularly striking because the data were drawn through a “grounded theory” approach. Interview questions were open-ended and assumed no hypothesis regarding what kinds of experiences, perspectives and behaviors pastors might share. Nevertheless, remarkable consistency is present in the findings.  Conclusion. The study concludes that pastors’ passion for the Bible, understanding of pastoral identity, personal characteristics, pedagogical approach, and formative experiences combine to empower pastors to successfully create communities of engagement around the Bible. It further claims that forming pastors who successfully lead ordinary readers to informed, enthusiastic engagement with the Bible is the responsibility of many parts of the “ecology of ministry,” including congregations, regional and national church bodies, colleges and universities, seminaries, agencies, retreat and conference centers, publishers, and other supporting organizations. As pastors are being formed as children, growing into young adults, being equipped for ministry, being called to particular ministry assignments, and carrying out their ministries in various congregations and communities, all parts of “the system” have major roles to play in lighting the fire of passion for Scripture and in nurturing habits of mind and heart that support the development of effective pastor-teachers.</jats:p>",employee engagement,0.0,,James White Library,,dissertation,0
