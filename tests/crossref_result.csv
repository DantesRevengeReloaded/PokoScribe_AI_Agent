An empirical study on factors influencing level of employee engagement with reference to select organization,10.26643/gis.v14i4.5341,0,Dr. Srikrishna Gade; Lavanya. K,"<jats:p>There is no exact definition for the term Employee engagement yet. The term Employee engagement means that the employee feel the belongingness towards the organization always strives to the growth of their organization. An Engaged employee means one who fully enthusiastic about their work and takes positive action for organizations reputation and interests. Employee engagement first appeared as a concept in management theory in 1990s. Employee engagement practices are well established in the management of human resources. &#x0D;
An organization with high employee engagement might have higher productivity than the organizations having less employee engagement level employees. Whereas employee engagement is directly proportional to the organizations productivity as higher the engagement level of employee results higher efficiency and productivity. Also the employee engagement may directly or indirectly relate to the job satisfaction or morale of employee. By understanding the importance of employee engagement many organizations are doing engagement practices such as providing great work place culture, employee development programs to enhance the engagement level of employee to raise productivity and daily performances. </jats:p>",employee engagement,9.0,https://journals.eduindex.org/index.php/gis/article/download/5341/2597,Edupedia Publications,GIS Business,journal-article,0

"Analysis of the Importance of Job Insecurity, Psychological Safety and Job Satisfaction in the CSR-Performance Link",10.3390/su12093514,0,Min-Jik Kim; Byung-Jik Kim,"<jats:p>Existing works on the association between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and performance have investigated how CSR affects external stakeholders (e.g., shareholders, customers, local communities, and environment). However, the effect of CSR on internal stakeholders such as employees who ultimately determine organizational performance is relatively underexplored. Institutional theory suggests that institutional enablers, e.g., CSR practices, influence macro-level variables, like organizational performance, via micro-level intermediating processes, such as perceptions, attitudes and behaviors of employees. Thus, this paper proposes that internal mechanisms are essential to explain the CSR-performance link. Using a 3-wave time-lagged survey data of 301 workers in South Korean firms (144 men and 157 women, average age: 40.30), this research examines how psychological safety and job satisfaction of an employee function as sequential mediators in the CSR-performance link. Moreover, the current research also investigates how job insecurity negatively moderates the link between CSR and psychological safety. The results demonstrated that psychological safety and job satisfaction function as sequential internal mediators in the link. In addition, job insecurity negatively moderated the influence of CSR on psychological safety. The results suggest that an employee’s perceptions and attitudes, such as job insecurity, psychological safety, and job satisfaction, significantly influence the relationship between CSR and performance.</jats:p>",job satisfaction,7.35,,MDPI AG,Sustainability,journal-article,35

Horizontal pay dispersion as social context for predicting employee performance outcomes associated with diagnostic‐ versus criterion‐referenced performance feedback,10.1111/apps.12458,2024,Daniel G.

Patel; Paul Levy,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Despite its recognised centrality as an organisational tool, there are decades of mixed findings relating to the employee performance benefits associated with different forms of performance feedback. The ambiguity present in the literature has been attributed to multiple factors, including feedback purpose and the context within which feedback occurs. Integrating these broad themes, we develop a model expanding the breadth of relevant social context variables to include horizontal pay dispersion. Building from tournament theory, in a field experiment of 267 employees across 22 units, we find improved performance from diagnostic feedback delivered under increasing pay dispersion; however, substantively different patterns emerge for criterion‐referenced feedback. The current findings have implications for both performance feedback research and tournament theory.</jats:p>",employee performance,6.8,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/apps.12458,Wiley,Applied Psychology,journal-article,0
Strengthening the Link Between Organizational Culture and Employee Loyalty: Exploring the Mediating Effects of Employee Trust and Job Satisfaction,10.17549/gbfr.2023.28.3.68,2023, ; Hoang Hien Pham; Thanh Tuan Tran,"<jats:p>Purpose: This research investigates the role of employee trust and job satisfaction in the relationship between organizational culture and employee loyalty.
Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted among 355 healthcare professionals working in a private healthcare system in southern cities of Vietnam, including doctors, nurses, and other medical staff. The research method employed was partial least squared structure equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with SmartPLS software for data analysis.

The study uses data collected from employees in organizations in Botswana (n = 438) to assess the relationship between social resources and employee engagement using Ubuntu as a mediating variable. Using mediation analysis, findings suggest that high levels of Ubuntu enhance the strength of the relationship among supervisor support, colleague support and employee engagement.

Overqualification as Moderator for the Link Between Job Change and Job Satisfaction Among Immigrants and Natives in Germany,10.31235/osf.io/q7nu2,0,Samir Khalil; Almuth Lietz; Sabrina Jasmin Mayer,"<p>Job satisfaction is a major driver of an individual’s subjective well-beingand thus affects public health, societal prosperity, and organisations, asdissatisfied employees are less productive and more likely to change jobs.However, changing jobs does not necessarily lead to higher job satisfactionin the long run. Previous studies have shown, instead, that changingjobs only increases job satisfaction for a short period of time beforeit gradually falls back to similar levels as before. This phenomenon isknown as the ’honeymoon–hangover’ pattern. In our study, we identifyan important new moderator of the relation between job change and jobsatisfaction: the job–qualification match of job change. Based on relativedeprivation theory, we argue that a job change from being overqualified ina job lowers the likelihood of negative comparisons and thus increases thehoneymoon period and lessens the hangover period. In addition, we investigatewhether this moderating effect is less pronounced among immigrants,since the phenomenon of overqualification occurs more frequentlyamong immigrants. We use data from the Socio-Economic Panel rangingfrom 1994–2018 and focus specifically on individual periods of employeesbefore and after job changes (N=134,417). Our results confirm that achange to a job that requires a matched qualification has a stronger andlonger-lasting effect on job satisfaction, and that this effect is slightly lowerfor respondents born abroad.</p>",job satisfaction,5.02,,Center for Open Science,,posted-content,2

The study was conducted in Region XI which is located at the Southeastern  part  of  Mindanao, Philippines. The employees of print media companies in Region XI were the respondents particularly those in printing press business industry that offers printing, publications, and adverting services. There were 419 employees of printing industry participated in the study. The study was employed the questionnaires adapted from different studies and to fit the context of the respondents of this study. The instrument was divided into four parts such as Innovative Work Behavior, Work Engagement, Organization learning and Work Performance. Results revealed that there is a significant relationship between innovative work behavior, organizational learning, work engagement and work performance of print media employees. Among the three independent variables, only the organizational learning and work engagement significantly predict employees work performance while the innovative work behavior does significantly predict employees work performance. Since organizational learning and work engagement were significant predictors of employees work performance, it is recommended that the management of print media will consider these variables in formulating training like advance multimedia, seminars on capacity building, and rewards and incentives program to improve employees work performance.</p>",work performance,5.0,,Center for Open Science,,posted-content,0
Effect of Psychological Contract on Employee Turnover Intention: Moderating Role of Select Demographic Variables,10.54517/esp.v9i5.1793,0,Neha Sharma; Sandeep Kaur,"<jats:p>Since the inception and the spread of COVID-19 from March 2020 in India, companies have experienced a rapid increase in the rate of unemployment as well as employee turnover intention. However, though employer appears to have additional power due to high unemployment levels, but it’s also been balanced by employees having new and more alternatives over whom they get employed due to extensive adoption of remote working by all the companies. Employees are highly satisfied at the workplace, prone to get retained with the organization, develop faith in the organizational system only if there is fulfillment of their psychological contract; employer’s showing concern for employees. This study aims to examine the relationship between psychological contract and employee turnover intention for the employees working in general insurance companies in India. The study further explores the moderating effect of select demographic variables for the relationship between psychological contract and employee turnover intention. These demographic variables are considered as independent groups and their moderation effect relationship between Psychological Contract and Employee Turnover Intention is tested with the help of SMART PLS software. The findings are insightful and will pave the way for the insurance companies to retain the employees by reducing their employee turnover intention and focusing on fulfillment of psychological contract.</jats:p>",employee turnover,5.0,https://esp.apacsci.com/index.php/esp/article/viewFile/1793/1221,Arts and Science Press Pte.

"MODELLING THE LINK BETWEEN CONFLICT MANAGEMENT STYLES, ORGANISATIONAL TRUST AND EMPLOYEE JOB SATISFACTION",10.36713/epra15559,0, Talatu Raiya Umar;  Bashir Farouq Umar,"<jats:p>While past studies have established a significant and positive relationship between conflict management styles and employee job satisfaction. However, the fundamental interaction behind this link remain unclear. To address this gap, calls for further research has been suggested, particularly on the interactive process through which conflict management styles, specifically, collaborating, accommodating, compromising, avoiding and dominating styles were cast as the key dimensions of conflict management styles that are likely to influence employee job satisfaction. Hence, in the present study a structured questionnaire was used to collect data from Academic and Non-academic staff of some selected public tertiary institutions located in North-Central and North-Western parts of Nigeria. Partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was adopted to test the hypothesized research model. The quantitative results indicated that collaborating, dominating, avoiding and compromising conflict management styles were significantly and positively related to employee job satisfaction. On the contrary, accommodating style demonstrated no significant effect on employee job satisfaction. The results further showed that organisational trust moderated the relationship between collaborating, avoiding, and compromising styles and employee job satisfaction. But, no significant interaction effect was found between organisational trust and both dominating and accommodating styles. Implications of the results for future research and practice, as well as the limitations of the study are highlighted.

HRM and Employee Engagement Link: Mediating Role of Employee Well-being,10.1177/0972150917713369,2018,P. Sivapragasam; R. P. Raya,"<jats:p> The debate concerning the link between human resource management (HRM) and employee level as well as organizational outcomes has reached an interesting crossroads. While studies continue to demonstrate a relationship between financial success and the organization’s commitment to management practices that support people’s goals and treat people as assets, yet in reality, the focus on achieving short-term financial performance has obscured the consideration of people-oriented goals. Given the centrality of HRM practices to organizational success, this study reports the results of a survey conducted among 626 knowledge professionals working in IT companies in Chennai city of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The study found statistically significant relationship between HRM practices and employee-level outcomes such as perceived efficacy, engagement and employee well-being, where employee well-being plays a mediating role. The implications of the findings of the theory and practice of HRM have been discussed. </jats:p>",employee engagement,4.09,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0972150917713369,SAGE Publications,Global Business Review,journal-article,49

Employee turnover in manufacturing SMEs in Japan: an analysis of the link with HRM practices,10.4038/suslj.v13i1.7668,0,Aruna S. Gamage,"<jats:p>Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector is playing a significant role in Japanese economy. However, over the last two decades, SMEs have no longer been a thriving source of growth. The firm entry rate has downward trend while exit rate has trended upward in recent years and considerably exceeded the entry rate. One of the reasons for the high rate of business failures in SMEs, is due to its less attention to the human side of their businesses when compared with their counter parts of large enterprises. High voluntary turnover is considered to be the one of critical problem for SME owner/managers among many other human resource issues. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to examine the relationship between Human Resource Management (HRM) practices and voluntary turnover in SMEs in Japan. Specifically, this study attempts to examine the relationship between HRM practices and voluntary turnover shedding some lights on the mediating effect of the link in between HRM practices and turnover rate. A structured questionnaire was developed and sent to 436 SMEs in Aichi Prefecture and 144 firms responded to the questionnaire resulting in 32 percent response rate. Based on the data analysis it was found that there is negative but weak relationship, partially mediated by HR outcomes, between HRM practices and voluntary turnover rate in manufacturing SMEs in Japan.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.4038/suslj.v13i1.7668Sabaragamuwa University Journal 2014; V. 13 No. 1 pp 17-31</jats:p>",employee turnover,3.14,https://account.suslj.sljol.info/index.php/sljo-j-suj/article/download/7668/5835,Sri Lanka Journals Online (JOL),Sabaragamuwa University Journal,journal-article,14

Professional Satisfaction as a Key Factor in Employee Retention: A case of the Service Sector,10.29036/jots.v11i20.123,0,Yeliz Pekerşen; Onur Tugay,"<jats:p>The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between the reasons for workers employed in catering and kitchen departments leaving their jobs and their job satisfaction. In accordance with this purpose, data were collected by a convenience sampling method with 244 employees between 10.04.2019-24.04.2019 including food and beverage and kitchen departments in the three, four, and five-star hotels operating in Eskişehir. According to the data obtained, it is concluded that the majority of the hotel employees consider the fact that the wages paid in the enterprises are not satisfactory and that there is not a significant relationship between the reasons for hotel employees' ceasing of employment and their occupational satisfaction levels. It can be stated that employees have a great role in increasing the rate of profit, which is the main purpose of the hotel enterprises, to run the business smoothly, and to ensure customer satisfaction and loyalty. Therefore, it is an important issue to focus on meeting the professional satisfaction levels of the employees and determining the possible factors that may lead to ceasing employment.</jats:p>",employee satisfaction,2.1,https://jots.cz/index.php/JoTS/article/download/123/73,University College of Business in Prague,Journal of Tourism and Services,journal-article,10

A New Type of Standardized Statistical Work,10.23943/princeton/9780691179476.003.0002,2020,Arunabh Ghosh,"<p>This chapter explores early statistical work in the People's Republic of China's (PRC) Northeast, arguing that this work and the practical experience so gained was the foundation upon which the rest of the country's statistical apparatus was based. Unpacking the constituent elements of Wang Sihua's “new type of standardized statistical work” permits an articulation of the ways in which this new type of statistics was regarded as more standardized, correct, and scientific than what preceded it in the years before 1949. The chapter shows that the 1950s were shot through with the influence, rarely pedagogical or technical in nature but rather all-pervasive and methodological, of what by 1959 would come to be termed the Maoist model of ascertaining fact. This Maoist model, with its emphases on direct experience over technical knowledge and on ideological fervor as a source of expertise, rendered the earlier binary and the clean solutions it offered much more conflicted. As a result, statisticians and statistical workers throughout the 1950s found themselves not only transitioning from a “nonsocialist” to a “socialist” system of data collection and analysis but also operating in a milieu that particularly valued personal, individual, practical experience.</p>",work performance,1.0,,Princeton University Press,Making It Count,book-chapter,0

Organizational Commitment and Employees' Performance Ratings: Both Type of Commitment and Type of Performance Count,10.2466/pr0.1994.75.3f.1539,1994,Harold L. Angle; Marian B. Lawson,"<jats:p> This study, conducted in a Fortune 500 manufacturing organization, examined the relationship between employees' commitment and performance. Several months after 85 employees' affective and continuance commitment had been measured, their global job performance and four specific performance facets were rated by their supervisors. Affective commitment was related to two performance facets but was unrelated to the other two facets. Continuance commitment was unrelated to any of the performance facets. Neither type of commitment was related to global performance. Results were interpreted as suggesting that the link between organizational commitment and performance may depend on the extent to which motivation rather than ability underlies performance.

Measuring metacognitive performance: type 1 performance dependence and test-retest reliability [now published in Neuroscience of Consciousness],10.31234/osf.io/jrkzm,0,Matthias Guggenmos,"<p>Research on metacognition − thinking about thinking − has grown rapidly and fostered our understanding of human cognition in healthy individuals and clinical populations. Of central importance is the concept of metacognitive performance, which characterizes the capacity of an individual to estimate and report the accuracy of primary (type 1) cognitive processes or actions ensuing from these processes. Arguably one of the biggest challenges for measures of metacognitive performance is their dependency on objective type 1 performance, although more recent methods aim to address this issue. In the present work we scrutinize the most popular metacognitive performance measures in terms of their validity (independence of type 1 performance) and test-retest reliability. Based on data of the Confidence Database we find that no current metacognitive performance measure is independent of type 1 performance. The shape of this dependency is reproduced by a simple computational model which considers metacognitive noise in addition to sensory noise. Moreover, we show that the reliability of metacognitive performance measures is highly sensitive to the combination of type 1 performance and trial number. Critically, trial numbers frequently employed in metacognition research are too low to achieve an acceptable level of test-retest reliability. Finally, we investigate design choices and analytical remedies to improve both validity and reliability and provide general recommendations for studies investigating metacognitive performance.</p>",employee performance,0.01,,Center for Open Science,,posted-content,1

The Pastor as Vital Link : a Study in How Seminary-Educated Pastors Engender Engagement with Scripture in Select Congregations,10.32597/dissertations/528/,0, ;  ; Jewel Longenecker,"<jats:p>Problem. The problem this study sought to address was the tendency of “ordinary readers” of Scripture to misuse the Bible on the one hand, or to give up reading it entirely, on the other hand. The purpose of this study was to develop a grounded theory that describes how seminary-educated pastors are successfully leading ordinary readers to informed, enthusiastic engagement with the Bible. The conceptual lenses through which research data were compared to literature in the field included teaching methodologies proposed by Wink, Blair, and Borsch.  Method. The study used a qualitative research design. It was field focused, utilized the “self” as the research instrument, used interpretation, employed expressive and first- person language and voice, and paid attention to particulars. The study offers a grounded theory that describes how seminary-educated pastors are successfully leading ordinary readers to informed, enthusiastic engagement with the Bible. The grounded theory grew out of interviews with six pastors who were chosen purposively. Pastors were chosen who (a) regularly lead adult Bible studies in their congregations; (b) are consciously utilizing tools of biblical interpretation gleaned in seminary as they prepare for and teach adult Bible studies; (c) perceive that congregational members who participate in these Bible studies are enthusiastically engaged with Scripture; and (d) perceive that congregational members who participate in these Bible studies are making use of tools of biblical interpretation. In addition, the grounded theory reflects interviews with participants in the studies these pastors are leading.  Results. Five major themes emerged from interviews with pastors: (a) their formative experiences with the Bible; (b) their passion for biblical formation; (c) their understanding of pastoral identity as it relates to Bible teaching; (d) their pedagogical approach; and (e) personal characteristics that support their Bible teaching. Although pastors came from diverse backgrounds and ministry settings, their experiences, perspectives and behaviors share a great deal in common. While pastors do not share a teaching technique in common, they do share an overall pedagogical approach in common, and they share much more in common than a pedagogical approach. This is particularly striking because the data were drawn through a “grounded theory” approach. Interview questions were open-ended and assumed no hypothesis regarding what kinds of experiences, perspectives and behaviors pastors might share. Nevertheless, remarkable consistency is present in the findings.  Conclusion. The study concludes that pastors’ passion for the Bible, understanding of pastoral identity, personal characteristics, pedagogical approach, and formative experiences combine to empower pastors to successfully create communities of engagement around the Bible. It further claims that forming pastors who successfully lead ordinary readers to informed, enthusiastic engagement with the Bible is the responsibility of many parts of the “ecology of ministry,” including congregations, regional and national church bodies, colleges and universities, seminaries, agencies, retreat and conference centers, publishers, and other supporting organizations. As pastors are being formed as children, growing into young adults, being equipped for ministry, being called to particular ministry assignments, and carrying out their ministries in various congregations and communities, all parts of “the system” have major roles to play in lighting the fire of passion for Scripture and in nurturing habits of mind and heart that support the development of effective pastor-teachers.</jats:p>",employee engagement,0.0,,James White Library,,dissertation,0
"Climate Concern and Engagement: Large Face-to-Face and Online Polls by the Dutch non-profit Milieudefensie (post-print, published article)",10.31234/osf.io/8xb92,0,Anna Bosshard; Cameron Brick; Anne Chatrou,"<p>Climate change mitigation depends on tracking public opinion across populations. Social scientists can collaborate with environmental organizations that conduct surveys among their audiences. We teamed up with the non-profit Milieudefensie, who surveyed Dutch attitudes towards climate change in 2019–2020. The large dataset had face-to-face (n= 3,102) and online interviews (n = 30,311) of urbanity, climate concern, policy preferences, interviewer-rated engagement with climate change, and behavior (whether the interviewee provided their email and phone number to the organization). To reveal the representativeness of these kinds of convenience samples, we tested whether attitudes and their associations with behaviors were similar to previous studies. Climate concern, preference for climate policy, and interviewer-rated engagement were high. In the online survey, 47% of respondents signed up for an email newsletter, and 7% provided their phone number. Higher climate concern and preference for climate policy predicted interviewer-rated engagement and behavior (weak to strong associations). Urbanity was not related to concern, policy preferences, or interviewer-rated engagement. Policy preferences did not differ between the face-to-face and online samples. The results provide convergent evidence to conventional online surveys. These Dutch residents appear slightly more engaged with systemic change to mitigate climate change than the general public.</p>",employee engagement,0.0,,Center for Open Science,,posted-content,0

Citizen Engagement in Print Media,10.59677/njlc.v16i2.59,0,Alexandra Tjiramanga,"<jats:p>This paper explores the content and communication acts of text messages in the form of SMSes written by Namibian citizens and published daily under “What you’re Saying!” in The Namibian. Its main aim is to provide insights into the realities of the population at grassroot-level, which are brought to light via the medium of the newspaper. Using the theoretical framework of Medium theory and theory of Cultural Hegemony, this paper argues that citizen engagement via SMS discloses how  public communication contributes to press freedom, problem solving and nation-building in Namibia. The “What you’re saying” platform enables alternative and activist citizen participation in the discussion of their choice. This study used 286 SMSes to identify areas of concern of Namibian citizens. The study’s objectives were to presents issues, such as eduation, health, or service delivery  directed to entities in the public and private sector, Further objectives include sub-themes, and communication acts, such as criticism, information-giving, complaint, suggestion, question, request, review and praise. The analysis discusses frequency of keywords in relation to the themes and sub-themes used. The findings are related to services and governance. Another feedback mechanism might be required to show responses to legitimate concerns.</jats:p>",employee engagement,0.0,http://journals.nust.na/index.php/njlc/article/download/59/22,Namibia University of Science and Technology,NAWA Journal of Language and Communication,journal-article,0

Some students are more equal: Performance in Author Recognition Test and Title Recognition Test modulated by print exposure and academic background,10.3758/s13428-023-02330-y,0,Marion Hug; Julian Jarosch; Christiane Eichenauer; Selina Pennella; Franziska Kretzschmar; Pascal Nicklas,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Reading is a key skill for university students. The Author Recognition Test (ART) and the Title Recognition Test (TRT) have both been used for decades to measure print exposure which correlates with reading and other linguistic skills. Given the available evidence for interindividual differences in reading skills, this study addresses three open issues. First, to what extent do ART and TRT scores correlate with individual differences regarding students’ study programs? Second, how do these results correlate with the self-reported time spent reading different types of text genres (e.g., fiction, nonfiction) per week? And third, this study compares ART and TRT to one another. We tested students from six study programs in the humanities and (medical) sciences which vary in the amount and kind of reading material required for study success. We found that students perform significantly differently in the ART and the TRT depending on their field of study. Students in a study program focusing on fiction and literature perform best overall. We also replicated the well-known effect of age on ART and TRT scores: older students have better scores. We did not find reliable effects of reading time on test performance, whereas individual creative writing habits did positively predict ART/TRT test results. These results raise a number of important questions regarding the ART/TRT in general and regarding interindividual differences in personal reading and writing habits and the change in reading habits in times of media convergence.</jats:p>",employee performance,0.0,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/s13428-023-02330-y.pdf,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Behavior Research Methods,journal-article,0

Some students are more equal: Performance in Author Recognition Test and Title Recognition Test modulated by print exposure and academic background,10.3758/s13428-023-02330-y,0,Marion Hug; Julian Jarosch; Christiane Eichenauer; Selina Pennella; Franziska Kretzschmar; Pascal Nicklas,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Reading is a key skill for university students. The Author Recognition Test (ART) and the Title Recognition Test (TRT) have both been used for decades to measure print exposure which correlates with reading and other linguistic skills. Given the available evidence for interindividual differences in reading skills, this study addresses three open issues. First, to what extent do ART and TRT scores correlate with individual differences regarding students’ study programs? Second, how do these results correlate with the self-reported time spent reading different types of text genres (e.g., fiction, nonfiction) per week? And third, this study compares ART and TRT to one another. We tested students from six study programs in the humanities and (medical) sciences which vary in the amount and kind of reading material required for study success. We found that students perform significantly differently in the ART and the TRT depending on their field of study. Students in a study program focusing on fiction and literature perform best overall. We also replicated the well-known effect of age on ART and TRT scores: older students have better scores. We did not find reliable effects of reading time on test performance, whereas individual creative writing habits did positively predict ART/TRT test results. These results raise a number of important questions regarding the ART/TRT in general and regarding interindividual differences in personal reading and writing habits and the change in reading habits in times of media convergence.</jats:p>",work performance,0.0,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/s13428-023-02330-y.pdf,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Behavior Research Methods,journal-article,0
