Job Satisfaction’s Impact on Employee Performance: The Mediating Role of Employee Engagement,,2024.0,"Danupranata, Gita; Maryati, Tri; Musoli, Musoli; Nugraha, Syahdani Satria","This study aims to examine the impact of job satisfaction (JS) on employee performance (EP) and examine the role of employee engagement (EE) in their relationship. This study was undertaken based on settled theories of job satisfaction (JS), employee performance (EP), and employee engagement (EE). It maintains that the employee's perceived JS can boost EP and that EE serves as a mediator in this relationship. Using a deductive approach and a quantitative research design, the study investigated the correlation between JS and EP in PKU Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta Hospital. Data from 131 respondents were analyzed utilizing AMOS with the help of SEM software. The data analysis uncovered that employee job satisfaction (JS) positively impacted performance (EP) in PKU Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta Hospital. In addition, employee engagement (EE) acted as a mediator between JS and EP. Job satisfaction felt by employees and creating employee engagement could boost EP in PKU Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta Hospital. The study highlights that providing job satisfaction to employees has broad benefits, including greater employee engagement, enhanced employee work, and a positive contribution to the development of PKU Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta Hospital. Practically, this research highlights the importance of creating employee job satisfaction. Employee satisfaction is something that organizations must pay attention to because it affects employee engagement and employee performance. Employees will be more active in carrying out their assigned tasks if they feel satisfied. Employees who feel connected (engaged) with the company will have an awareness of the organization so that employees will provide their best abilities and skills for the success of the organization. The theoretical implications of testing the correlation between job satisfaction and employee engagement on employee performance can enrich existing behavioral theories in organizations",N/A,18.8,https://core.ac.uk/download/617705130.pdf,'Universitas Muhammadiyah Sorong',N/A,N/A,0
"The Relationship Between Employee Engagement, Job Satisfaction, And Employee Performance in The Federal Government",,2022.0,"Shellow, Alexis L","Leaders in the U.S. Federal Government face performance challenges due to disengaged employees and employees with low satisfaction. Leaders within the federal government need to understand the relationship between employee engagement, job satisfaction, and employee performance, as decreased employee performance can result in decreased productivity, increased turnover, and have negative financial implications. Grounded in Herzberg’s two-factor theory and Kahn’s engagement theory, the purpose of this quantitative correlational ex post facto study was to examine the relationship between employee engagement, job satisfaction, and employee performance within the federal government. Data from the 2019 Federal Employment Viewpoint Survey (n = 100) were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. The multiple linear regression analysis results indicated the model was able to significantly predict performance F(2,97) = 43.836, p \u3c .001, R2 = .475. Employee engagement (t = 3.594, p \u3c .001, β = .504) was the only statistically significant predictor. A key recommendation for leaders in the federal government to engage federal employees is to recognize employee achievements, create a work environment promoting psychological safety, provide employees with adequate resources, and have well-defined roles and responsibilities for employees while allowing them to exercise autonomy in their work processes. The implications for positive social change include the potential for cost savings, helping leaders in the federal government assess areas of improvement, creating a more productive environment for improved employee performance, and increasing employee retention and job satisfaction in the workforce",N/A,18.4,https://core.ac.uk/download/580005621.pdf,'IUScholarWorks',N/A,N/A,0

have been severely impacted. These industries were hit harder than others, resulting in a significant
drop in employee numbers and a significant increase in the number of people on temporary leave.
As a result, the impact of the pandemic on the motivation, job satisfaction, and employee
engagement of Ghanaian hospitality and tourism workers was investigated in this study. The
study's goal was to answer the following research questions: i) Does employee motivation predict
job satisfaction? (ii) Does employee engagement predict job satisfaction? (iii) Does employee
engagement predict job satisfaction? (iv) Does motivation act as a mediating variable in the direct
relations between employee engagement and job satisfaction? Participants ranged in age from 18
to 60 years old and came from various backgrounds. With the help of a third variable, employee
engagement, the collected data was analyzed using mediation analysis in the statistical software

motivation and job satisfaction. Employee motivation and job satisfaction were found to have a
significant positive relationship, implying that higher employee motivation is associated with
higher job satisfaction. When controlling for the effects of job motivation on job satisfaction and
employee engagement on job satisfaction, there was also a significant positive relationship between employee motivation and employee engagement. Again, there was a significant positive

Social Security Administration Employee Lived Experiences of Job Satisfaction and Employee Turnover,,2018.0,"Cain, Lafaun","Employee turnover continues to be an issue in federal organizations, including the Social Security Administration (SSA). While issues such as retiring baby boomers and budget constraints are beyond the control of any agency, retaining employees is critical to maintain essential services. The purpose of this transcendental phenomenological study was to explore SSA employee\u27s lived experiences of job satisfaction and employee turnover to uncover motivators and satisfaction strategies. The conceptual framework for the study was based on Maslow\u27s human needs and Herzberg\u27s two-factor theory. Data were collected from 20 SSA frontline employees using 6 open-ended interview questions. The data were analyzed using a modification of van Kaam\u27s method of analysis of phenomenological data and NVivo 11 Pro. Study results revealed that time, stress, pay and benefits, public service, and interoffice relationships were the prime intrinsic and extrinsic factors participants perceived as directly related to their job satisfaction. They highly valued job enrichment programs, cohesive teams, and pay and benefits, which override daily stressors inherent to the public demands strategies for the agency. Conducting the study in depressed socioeconomic areas might also provide significant insights, particularly since stress and workload were essential dissatisfiers.

The impact of employee engagement on organizational productivity: case study of UVS.,,2017.0,"Moletsane, Malesedi Ruth.","Masters Degree. University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban.There is no evidence that links employee engagement to high productivity in the sugar
industry. Low levels of engagement have been observed in the South African manufacturing
industry. The objective of this study was to establish the factors that influence employee
engagement at Umhlathuze Valley Sugar (UVS) and to ascertain the impact of the
relationship between employee engagement and productivity, to highlight areas of focus to
UVS for a sustainable future. A quantitative study was done with a random sampling design
used to explore the impact of employee engagement on productivity. The sample group (N=
73) was made up of female and male UVS staff. The employee engagement questionnaire
that was used looked at different facets of employee engagement, these were; employee
commitment towards their work, internal communication and how leadership style affects
their engagement levels, employee well-being and how person job-fit influenced employee
engagement. The organizational productivity questionnaire used also looked at various
facets, which included; employee punctuality, commitment of employees to produce high
quality work and meet deadlines, employee absenteeism and minimisation of waste to
improve productivity. The study used descriptive statistics to analyse the data. The findings
from the study indicate that UVS has a sufficiently engaged workforce, but there is a
significant room for improvement. The participants also revealed an awareness of the impact
of their engagement levels towards company productivity. However, in terms of job
satisfaction and employee well-being, UVS employees are dissatisfied with their
compensation packages and the lack of support in as far as work conditions are concerned.
Employee motivation directed towards improving employee contribution towards
productivity, HR policies aimed at creating an inclusive workplace as well as strategies of
improving workplace conditions, are some of the recommendations from this study. Finally,

"Performance appraisal purposes in Kwara State Civil Service, Nigeria: analysis of employee engagement and performance.",,2020.0,"Ameen, Lateef","The existing study in the administration research field signifies that employee engagement and employee performance are crucial to the effectiveness of civil service. This is due to the fact that organizational performance and success significantly hinge on both of the factors. However, very slight consideration has been given to the relationship between performance appraisal purposes (PAP) and employee engagement as well as employee performance in the context of civil service. The main aim of this research is to examine the relationship between PAP (training, job promotion, performance feedback, performance recognition and financial reward) and engagement and performance of civil servants in Kwara State

Civil Service, Nigeria.To validate the instruments employed in this study, seven (7) experts were consulted for content validation of the adapted scales before a pilot study was conducted among 100 respondents. Subsequently, a total number of 510 civil servants were involved in this study. Data for the study were gathered through quantitative and qualitative surveys from employees working in the Kwara State civil service. PLS-SEM was used to test the study’s hypotheses. The results provided support for six (6) out of the eleven (11) hypotheses. The overall findings signify that job promotion, performance recognition and financial reward have a significant positive relationship with employee engagement, while training and performance feedback have insignificant relationship with employee engagement.The results also indicated that training and financial reward have a significant and positive relationship with employee performance, while the job promotion, performance feedback and performance recognition have insignificant relationships with employee performance. Moreover, the results reveal a significant relationship between employee engagement and employee performance.

An investigation of employee engagement and business outcomes at an engineering services firm,,2012.0,"Gill, Preetinder Singh","This research study investigated the constructs and dimensions of employee engagement and their relationship with business outcome data from 2009 to 2011 at a mid-sized engineering services firm and two of its business units. Employee engagement ratios, as defined by Crabtree (2004), for all entities studied were below that associated with world-class organizations. Survey items related to salary and compensation received low scores from both engaged and disengaged employees. Kruskal-Wallis’s median comparison tests revealed that many survey items varied over the period of three years for each entity studied. A factor analysis of companywide survey data yielded 5 dimensions of employee engagement, which was consistent with existing literature of Cummings and Worley (2008), Richman (2006), Shaw (2005), and Robinson et al. (2004). Structural equation modeling revealed that the dimension of communication has a causal relationship with the dimension of management effectiveness, which, in turn, has causal relationships with dimensions of 1) salary and compensation, 2) opportunity for development and recognition, and 3) alignment with the organization. A single variable linear regression analysis between average ratings of every survey item and every selected business outcome showed that a significant relationship existed between several pairs of variables for each entity studied. However, many of these pairs were found to be inversely proportional. This finding, subject to limitations and assumptions of this study, is inconsistent with the findings of Harter et al. (2009) and Buckingham and Coffman (1999).
The study uncovered many areas of improvement and elucidated several solutions aimed at enhancing employee engagement at the engineering services firm. New possible v relationships between employee engagement and business outcomes are also presented. These possible relationships in turn serve as an impetus for future research. Additional research work is needed to understand intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence and promote employee engagement at services firms. Structural equation modeling procedures could be used to develop a better understanding of how these factors influence employee engagement and business outcomes",N/A,10.0,https://core.ac.uk/download/268101177.pdf,DigitalCommons@EMU,N/A,N/A,0

"EFFECT OF MONETARY INCENTIVES ON PERFORMANCE OF SMALL

AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES IN KENYA:

A CASE STUDY OF GRAPHIC LINEUPS LIMITED",,,"MUHUMED, AHMED DEKA","The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of monetary incentives on

Performance of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Kenya. The specific objectives

of the study were to: identify effect of job satisfaction on performance of SMEs, examine

the effect of employee motivation on performance of SMEs, determine the effect of

employee engagement on performance of SMEs, identify the effect of turnover on

performance of SMEs and examine the effect of employee commitment on performance

of SMEs. Research questions were developed from the specific objectives of the study.

Scope and significance were set from the research questions. Findings of this study will

introduce new comparative knowledge for the effect of monetary incentives on

Performance of SMEs in Kenya. Review of related theoretical literature provided the

theoretical rationale of the problem under study, while variables were deciphered from

analysis of empirical literature. Observed research gaps were used to develop the

appropriate conceptual framework. Descriptive research design was used in setting the

methodology for the research. Target population was 65 respondents, which formed the

sample size as census approach was adopted. Data was collected through questionnaires

and interviews, was analyzed using SPSS using both descriptive and inferential analysis.

Results were presented in tables, graphs and charts. Findings indicate that job

satisfaction has no statistically significant effect on performance of SMEs. Results

indicate that financial incentives did not lead to job satisfaction and job satisfaction has

no effect on performance of SMEs. Results also indicate that employee motivation has

statistically significant effect on performance of SMEs. Results further indicate that

employee engagement has statistically significant effect on performance of SMEs.

Results indicate that employee turnover has statistically significant effect on performance

of SMEs. Results indicate that employee commitment has statistically insignificant effect

on performance of SMEs. The study concludes job satisfaction does not lead to enhanced

employee performance therefore offering financial incentive may not improve employee

performance. Monetary incentives lead to enhanced motivation which leads to increased

employee performance. Monetary incentives lead to employee’s engagement which leads

to higher employee performance. Incentives reduce staff turnover in the organization

which enhances overall job performance. Monetary incentives do very little in ensuring

employees commitment and therefore may not lead to enhanced employee performance.

The study recommends that organizations should put measures in place to ensure job

satisfaction through attractive monetary incentives. The organization should motivate

employees as a priority through reasonable monetary incentives. Incentives should aim at

ensuring that the employees are more engaged in organization activities and thereby

promote productivity. The organization should use monetary incentives to improve

satisfaction and reduce the employee’s turnover. Incentives should be aimed at keeping

employees committed to organization goals and objectives",N/A,10.0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/224836840.pdf,,N/A,N/A,0

This gap was the impetus for the present research in identifying the factors of employee engagement at the organizational level. This research was guided by the following research problem: “how and why the factors of employee engagement outcomes at the organizational level could be established within the Malaysia SME business?” The synthesis of literature on employee engagement outcomes at the organizational level produced three research issues. In order to investigate these issues, a qualitative study was conducted and the respondents were identified using the snowballing sampling technique. 12 convergent interviews were conducted to confirm the factors of employee engagement outcomes at the organizational level. The data were then analysed using the content analysis technique. The research findings confirmed 11 factors of employee engagement, i.e. employee retention, profitability, absenteeism, customer satisfaction, productivity, customer loyalty, organizational performance, self-efficacy of manager, advocacy of organization, business growth, and satisfaction of business partner.

Strategies Software Company Sales Managers Implemented to Reduce Voluntary Employee Turnover,,2016.0,"Taylor, Pete","The high rates of voluntary employee turnover in software sales organizations have forced business leaders to search for strategies that reduce voluntary employee turnover. The purpose of this multiple case study was to explore the strategies of a small group of sales managers who had demonstrated reduced voluntary employee turnover in their software manufacturing companies. Ten managers from 5 software manufacturing companies who had a minimum of 5 years of management experience were recruited and participated in semistructured, face-to-face interviews. The conceptual framework included Herzberg\u27s 2-factor theory for exploring the relationship between job satisfaction and voluntary employee turnover. Open and frequent communications, constant performance feedback, and transparency align appropriately with the tenets of Herzberg\u27s 2-factor theory. The Yin method for analyzing data through the process of data grouping, scrubbing, and organizing resulted in the emergence of themes including communications, recognition, and the work environment. All 10 sales managers spoke extensively about the importance of these themes in reducing voluntary employee turnover. These managers \u27noticed the little things,\u27 they gladly celebrated team successes, and they visibly supported their teams through actions. Findings from this study will provide a positive influence on social change through productivity improvements resulting in lower cost products and services, improving community prosperity.

The Connection Between Wellness Programs and Employee Job Satisfaction in Higher Education,,2016.0,"Richemond, Donel J.","Job dissatisfaction is becoming a fundamental concern for employers. Employee engagement makes an organization more productive and can reduce absenteeism. The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the relationship between employer-sponsored wellness-program participation and job satisfaction among for-profit college and university leaders. Data collection involved an online survey of 400 faculty members\u27 from for-profit universities in the United States contacted using the Job Satisfaction Survey; 103 participants completed the survey. The theoretical framework was the need-satisfaction theory, which includes the factors that promote job satisfaction and job dissatisfaction. The results came from a multiple regression analysis that indicated a significant negative relationship between job satisfaction and participation in the employer-sponsored wellness program (Î² = -.22, t = -2.24, p = .027), where faculty who were not participating in the wellness program had higher levels of job satisfaction (M = 3.62) in comparison to those who did participate (M = 3.80). Interaction analyses indicated a relationship between gender and job satisfaction (Î² = -.26, t = -2.70, p = .008). Females were more likely than were males to have higher levels of job satisfaction, as well as years of experience and job satisfaction. Faculty who had been employed for between 11 and 15 years were more likely to have higher levels of job satisfaction. Job satisfaction appear lower for those who participate in employer-sponsored wellness programs because of the personal gratification employees\u27 experience.

Hotel Managers\u27 Motivational Strategies for Enhancing Employee Performance,,2016.0,"Barbosa-McCoy, Vanessa Lizzette","More than 600,000 employees depart the hospitality industry for a variety of reasons such as lack of motivational strategies (MS) of hotel general managers (GMs). The purpose of this multiple case study using census sampling was to explore what MS hotel GMs used to enhance employee performance. The 3 GMs of 3 full-service branded hotels with a guest capacity of 160-699 were randomly selected in South Florida. Data were collected from face-to-face interviews with the hotel GMs, employee performance evaluations, and results of guest and employee satisfaction surveys from the hotel GMs. Data analysis involved methodological triangulation to determine how motivation was captured and measured using interpreted data, verification through the member-checking process, and coding techniques such as mind mapping to identify reoccurring codes and categories. Through thematic analysis, 4 major themes emerged: workplace motivation, job satisfaction, positive performance, and social expectation. Findings from the 4 themes revealed that recognition and guest satisfaction unveiled a positive effect on employee performances and that motivation through community engagement gave employees reasons to perform well. The effectiveness of MS on employee performance was conceptualized by the expectancy theory to determine motivational triggers and the behavior engineering model to determine which MS led to improved performance. Social implications include encouraging hotel GMs to adjust and develop motivational strategies that engage employees to improve the employee-customer relationship and to increase community involvement which may promote positive social change",N/A,9.2,https://core.ac.uk/download/147834805.pdf,'IUScholarWorks',N/A,N/A,0
Moderating Effect of Within-team Trust on Employee Engagement and Workgroup Outcomes,,2014.0,"Anderson, Scott J.","Abstract: This study explored daily variability of employee engagement. The study used daily measures of hindrance demands, challenge demands, and employee engagement to examine the relationship between these constructs as well as for their influence on outcomes of job satisfaction, productivity, and safety for workgroup members. Additionally, I explored high-involvement management as an antecedent of employee engagement. The main area of interest was evaluating the influence of within-team trust as a potential modifier of the relationship between employee engagement and job satisfaction, safety, and productivity. While not a consistent occurrence across all days of the survey period in this study, there were days when a statistically significant conditional indirect effect was found in the relationship between employee engagement and job satisfaction when within-team trust was incorporated as a modifier in the model. This influence was observed on Day 1 for the indirect path of hindrance demands through employee engagement to job satisfaction and on both Day 3 and Day 4 for the indirect path of high-involvement management through employee engagement to job satisfaction. This implies that the potential role of within-team trust as a modifier of an employee's level of engagement on employee perception measures such as job satisfaction.Business Administratio",N/A,9.0,https://core.ac.uk/download/215309238.pdf,'Oklahoma State University Library',N/A,N/A,0

This study employed regression modeling on online survey collected data. Findings/Results: Research has demonstrated that human resource management (HRM) practices, including job security, empowerment, training, and quality of work life, have a substantial influence on employee retention rates. Furthermore, job satisfaction emerges as another critical determinant of the duration employees choose to stay with their present employer.Conclusions: Furthermore, the results of the regression analysis indicate that there is a direct link between HRM practices and employee retention. However, this connection is significantly stronger when job satisfaction levels are initially increased. As a result, effective HRM practices have been shown to enhance employee satisfaction, leading to greater loyalty and commitment to the company.Originality/value (state of the art): This study aims to enhance our understanding of the relationships between human resource management (HRM) practices, employee satisfaction, and employee retention. While previous research on the connection between HRM practices and employee satisfaction is limited, this study is noteworthy for exploring the effects of four dimensions of HRM practices on employee satisfaction, and how this in turn impacts employee retention.

This entails exploring the various factors that significantly impact employee satisfaction within an organization, with the goal of identifying key drivers that have a profound effect on the morale and motivation of the workforce. By understanding these crucial factors, organizations can employ diverse strategies to enhance employee performance, thereby maximizing both individual and organizational objectives.
In today\u27s competitive market landscape, human resources are undeniably a critical asset for any organization. With intense competition, businesses are relentlessly striving to enhance customer satisfaction to gain a competitive edge. The utilization of human resources has a direct and substantial impact not only on customer satisfaction but also on gaining a competitive advantage. Consequently, it is imperative for managers to consistently assess employee satisfaction and pay close attention to the variables that exert significant influence on both employee satisfaction and performance. To investigate employee satisfaction and its ramifications on employee performance, this study employs a survey method. The utilization of an experimental approach is deemed unnecessary for this research, as employee satisfaction primarily involves theoretical aspects, making experimental methodologies redundant. Data for this research was collected through questionnaires, constituting primary data, targeting managers at various organizational levels within the private sector.
The analysis of the gathered data reveals a robust positive correlation between employee satisfaction and employee performance. Notably, the variables most closely associated with employee satisfaction, and subsequently, with a significant impact on employee performance, are employee creativity and reduced absenteeism. Consequently, it can be confidently asserted that there exists a strong, positive relationship between employee satisfaction, employee performance, and the attainment of organizational goals",N/A,8.6,https://core.ac.uk/download/597862401.pdf,Stallion Publication,N/A,N/A,0

Methodology: The population of this study was the educational staff at the University of X. The sampling technique used in this study was stratified random sampling, involving a total of 50 educational staff as samples. Data collection was done using a performance scale, job satisfaction scale, and transformational leadership scale. The data were analyzed using the path regression ordinary least square technique.
Main Findings: The results showed that transformational leadership has a significant effect on job satisfaction of educational staff, transformational leadership does not effect on performance of educational staff, job satisfaction has a significant effect on performance of educational staff and transformational leadership has a significant effect on performance through job satisfaction as a mediator of educational staff. Thus, job satisfaction can play a good role as a mediator.
Applications of this study: Satisfaction has an important role in increasing work productivity which includes quantity and quality of work, timeliness of work, work effectiveness, independence, and commitment. Leaders in implementing a transformational leadership style must be accompanied by efforts to create a work environment that supports the realization of the job satisfaction of its employees. Regardless of employee job satisfaction, the leader’s transformational leadership style will be in vain.
Novelty: To the best of our knowledge, research on job satisfaction as a mediating variable in the effect of transformational leadership on the performance of educational staff is still rarely done both in Indonesia and abroad. Previous studies only positioned job satisfaction as an independent variable that affects performance and not as a mediator variable.

job satisfaction as a mediator of the educational staff at the University of X Yogyakarta, and the direct effect of job 

satisfaction on the performance of educational staff at the University of X Yogyakarta.

Methodology: The population of this study was the educational staff at the University of X. The sampling technique 

used in this study was stratified random sampling, involving a total of 50 educational staff as samples. Data collection 

was done using a performance scale, job satisfaction scale, and transformational leadership scale. The data were 

analyzed using the path regression ordinary least square technique.

Main Findings: The results showed that transformational leadership has a significant effect on job satisfaction of 

educational staff, transformational leadership does not effect on performance of educational staff, job satisfaction has a 

significant effect on performance of educational staff and transformational leadership has a significant effect on 

performance through job satisfaction as a mediator of educational staff. Thus, job satisfaction can play a good role as a 

mediator.

Applications of this study: Satisfaction has an important role in increasing work productivity which includes quantity 

and quality of work, timeliness of work, work effectiveness, independence, and commitment. Leaders in implementing a 

transformational leadership style must be accompanied by efforts to create a work environment that supports the 

realization of the job satisfaction of its employees. Regardless of employee job satisfaction, the leader’s transformational 

leadership style will be in vain. 

Novelty: To the best of our knowledge, research on job satisfaction as a mediating variable in the effect of 

transformational leadership on the performance of educational staff is still rarely done both in Indonesia and abroad.

A Contemporary Approach to Managing Social Responsibility in Relation to Employees as Perceived in Academic Papers,10.7160/eriesj.2020.130301,2020.0,"Jarkovská, Martina; Jarkovská, Petra","Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) plays a significant role in Human Resource Management (HRM), especially when it comes to stipulating desired employee performance or behaviour, such as work performance, job satisfaction, organizational commitment or retention. However, the academic literature offers very fragmented or partial answers to questions addressing this issue, as many scholars focus exclusively on e.g. one-country or one-industry based sample only. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to summarize the current ""state-of-the-art"" trends in academic literature and thereafter, based on the findings, propose a broader contemporary conceptual approach to managing CSR in relation to employees. The results suggest a positive causal relationship between CSR and desirable employee behaviour, with job satisfaction often playing the function of a mediator. The findings also suggest that adding CSR to HRM practices could improve employees' work attitudes.

Therefore, this study investigates how training and competence directly affect job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Indirectly, training and competence affect organizational commitment through job satisfaction. Survey-based data collection was collected by purposive sampling, which included 280 employees from BPJS who participated in the training. The findings from the path analysis, along with measurements and structural tests, are very supportive of the employee training program. The findings show that employee training and competence directly affect job satisfaction and organizational commitment. The findings also show that training and employee competence indirectly affect organizational commitment through job satisfaction. Finally, employee job satisfaction affects managerial competence.

The mediating effect of employee engagement on leadership styles and organizational commitment in Telekom Malaysia call centre,,2021.0,"Shahida Syafiqah, Abdullah","Highly committed to company’s overall business mission is particularly important for call centre, since agents’ behaviour and attitude has a direct impact on customer service. In employer-employee relationship, leadership plays an important role in people management in which understanding the significance of committed agents with effective leadership style enhance the success of call centre operating in today’s competitive environment. Nonetheless, previous studies discovered inconsistent results in organisational commitment and leadership styles relationship, particularly, transformational and transactional leadership styles. These inconsistencies led to a new line of research that shows how important it is to look at the effect of employee engagement as a potential mediating variable that could explain the relationship. Therefore, the present study investigated the relationships between leadership styles and organizational commitment in Telekom Malaysia call centre. Drawing upon the social exchange theory, the study also examined the mediating effect of employee engagement on the relationships between transformational leadership, transactional leadership and organizational commitment. Quantitative research design was adopted to collect the data and answer the research questions. Using a questionnaire survey, a total of 262 responses were collected from agents located in Kuala Lumpur. The data was analysed using PLS-SEM. The findings revealed that transactional leadership and employee engagement had positive influence on call centre agents’ organizational commitment, whereas, transformational leadership portrayed positive influence on employee engagement, but had no influence on organizational commitment. Employee engagement mediated the relationship between transactional leadership style and organizational commitment partially since transactional leadership style has both direct and indirect impacts on organisational commitment.

The importance of employee job satisfaction in the public sector,,2020.0,"Kedama, Nombuyiselo","The success of service delivery heavily relies on how satisfied employees are with their jobs, and how they are treated within the South African public sector. A number of deliberations can be described and linked to the importance of job satisfaction. Firstly, job satisfaction contributes to the mental health and general life satisfaction of employees. This may happen through acquiring self-esteem, which is a person's overall sense of self-worth and/or personal values. Organisations depend on the health, skills, knowledge, and ability of their human resources in order to stay abreast with technological developments and remain competent on the global stage as they pursue organisational goals and objectives. This dependence has given rise to the need to assess the importance of employee job satisfaction in the South African public sector. To that end, this study employed a desktop research method by reviewing journal articles, government gazettes, conference papers, and relevant books to gather data and conduct content analysis in order to establish facts about employee job satisfaction in the public sector. The study found that emotional, cognitive, and behavioural components make up job satisfaction. The feelings that an employee has regarding his or her job form the emotional component of job satisfaction n. In addition, boredom, anxiety, and excitement are the most common feelings experienced by employees when they perform their jobs.

Employee perceptions of supervisor support (ï?¢ = -.140, p = .580) did not relate to any significant variation in organizational profitability. The findings may be of value to QSR business professionals developing initiatives to improve organizational profitability. Improving employees\u27 perceptions of supervisor support to generate high levels of employee job satisfaction could affect behavioral social change to enhance the health and wellbeing of employees and the wealth and sustainability of QSR franchise locations",N/A,5.4,https://core.ac.uk/download/147837485.pdf,'IUScholarWorks',N/A,N/A,0
"Relationship Between Intrinsic Job Satisfaction, Extrinsic Job Satisfaction, and Turnover Intentions Among Internal Auditors",,2017.0,"Lee, Toccara Jeneshia","In the auditing profession, many business owners are unable to retain auditing staff. The cost to replace an auditor can cost a company as much as 150% of the auditors\u27 annual salary. Perpetuating this problem is that some auditing business owners do not know the relationship between internal auditors\u27 intrinsic job satisfaction, extrinsic job satisfaction, and auditors\u27 turnover intention. Grounded in Herzberg\u27s 2- factor theory, the purpose of this correlational study was to examine the relationship between intrinsic job satisfaction, extrinsic job satisfaction, and auditors\u27 turnover intention. Participants included 96 members of the Central Florida Institute of Internal Auditors. Data were collected using the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Michigan Organizational Assessment Questionnaire. Results of the multiple regression analysis indicated the model as a whole was able to significantly predict auditors\u27 turnover intentions, F(2, 93) = 47.635, p \u3c .001, R2 = .506. Extrinsic job satisfaction was the only significant predictor (t = -6.515, p \u3c .001). Implications for social change include the potential for leaders to better understand predictors of involuntary turnover and the potential to save money on recruitment and training. Business owners may become more profitable through better employee retention strategies; these findings may also add to the body of knowledge for stable employment opportunities. Business owners can develop strategies to enhance the level of intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction of internal auditors. Job satisfaction of internal auditors is essential and a fundamental determinant of growth, service, and quality within an organization",N/A,5.4,https://core.ac.uk/download/147837453.pdf,'IUScholarWorks',N/A,N/A,0

Human resource management practices and employee performance management in Nigerian higher educational institutions,,2014.0,"Nura, Abubakar Allumi","Previous studies on performance management system focus on one or two of its dimensions with little insight in the public sector, so also studies on human resource management practices did not attempt to use all the practices comprehensively. This study examined both individually and comprehensively the relationship between the six human resource management practices and all the four dimensions of performance management system among academics in higher educational institutions in Nigeria. The dimensions of performance management system as operationalized by this study are, organizational objective, individual objective, performance development and employee satisfaction. Human resource management practices also as operationalized by this study are procurement, development, compensation, integration, maintenance and separation. Furthermore, this study also investigated the mediating effects of employee behavior and information and communication technology (ICT) adoption on the relationship between human resource management practices and performance

management system among academics in higher educational institutions in Nigeria. Data was collected from five Federal universities in the North Western Nigeria using a cross sectional study design and multimode survey strategy. 800 questionnaires were distributed to the respondents who were sampled using a multi stage sampling technique. SmartPLS SEM was used in testing the study hypotheses. The results

obtained indicated that majority of the hypothesized relationships thirteen (13) out of

twenty (20) direct relationships were supported. Additionally, the results of the

mediation tests provided that five (5) mediating hypotheses out of twelve were

significant. The outcome of this study provides a very sound insight of the study on performance management system in the public sector particularly higher educational

institutions. It will also benefit the government, the policy makers and other

concerned agencies in Nigeria. More so, information and communication technology

and employee behaviors have been proven by this study as strategic tools that could be efficiently used by managers to effectively manage performance of their employees. This study encountered limitations such as inability to include other types of higher educational institutions like the polytechnics and colleges of education, unable to cover all the six regions in Nigeria instead focused on only one region the North West region",N/A,5.0,https://core.ac.uk/download/268139918.pdf,,N/A,N/A,0

Strategies for Retaining Employees in the Nonprofit Sector,,2018.0,"Parker, George","Voluntary employee turnover is a concern for nonprofit leaders due to human capital\u27s strategic role in achieving performance excellence. The consequences of volunteer turnover include loss of profitability, productivity, knowledge, and financial stability. The purpose of this single-case study was to explore strategies used by 3 leaders of a nonprofit organization in the Washington, DC, area who have experience with the nonprofit\u27s employee retention efforts. Data were collected from semistructured face-to-face interviews and organizational documentation and analyzed through the conceptual lens of Maslow\u27s hierarchy of needs theory. Data gathered from interviews and analyses of organizational data and performance outcomes were manually coded and thematically organized. The use of member checking the data and methodological triangulation increased the trustworthiness of data interpretation and the study. Three key themes emerged: (a) training and development, (b) advancement opportunities, and (c) strategic leadership. Through analysis of data collected for this study, nonprofit leaders can assess their employees\u27 development needs and provide training to support their growth. Nonprofit leaders may support their employees\u27 development by creating a career path by aligning tenure with advancement and formal training. Nonprofit leaders\u27 actions and decisions affect workforce commitment. Nonprofit employees are intrinsically motivated to create positive social change and make an impact on nonprofits\u27 stakeholders via programs and services.

Does Participation Matter? Exploring the Role of Participation in Corporate Leadership Development Programs on the Intent to Stay of High-Potential Employees in the Biotech Industry,,2024.0,"Griffin, Glenna M.","The idea of leadership development programs for high-potential employees within organizations has long been a standard for driving employee retention within organizations. Yet, employee retention is different from employee intent to stay. Retention metrics measure historical data, looking back to determine how long an employee has stayed in the organization. Employee intent to stay measures, at that moment, data that contribute to an employee’s motivation to stay with the organization. Employers spend significant budgets on leadership development programs for high-potential employees and report on that participation in company retention metrics. Does the investment in these programs also support an employee’s internal motivation to stay with the company, or are these programs better categorized as a development tool? Understanding the factors that compel employees to stay with the organization would reduce turnover and retraining costs by a significant margin. The aim of this bounded case study was to determine the factors of intent to stay for employees working in the biotechnology industry within the United States. Eight interviews were conducted with employees in the biotechnology industry, including four participants in leadership development programs and four non-participants in a leadership development program. Three themes emerged that drive overall employee intent to stay: positive employee experience, significant employee engagement, and a supportive employee ecosystem. Additional research is suggested to support these findings further and provide specific tactics employers can implement to increase the intent to stay for all employees",N/A,3.8,https://core.ac.uk/download/616424322.pdf,FireScholars,N/A,N/A,0
"Relationship Between Job Performance, Compensation, and Turnover Intention in the Retail Industry",,2022.0,"Sewell, Donald Lynn","Employee turnover intention can lead to voluntary employee turnover, costing retail organizations millions of dollars annually. Retail business leaders who fail to address voluntary turnover intention face increased voluntary employee turnover and reduced operational performance. Grounded in equity theory, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between employee job performance, employee compensation, and voluntary turnover intention in the retail industry. Data were collected from 76 Texas retail store management employees using the Self-Rated Job Performance Survey, Compensation Survey, and Modified Turnover Intention Scale. The results of the multiple linear regression were significant, F (2, 73) = 4.43, p = .01, R² = .11, indicating that job performance and compensation explained 11% of the variance in turnover intention. Only job performance (β = .26, t = 2.39, p = .02) made a unique contribution to the model. A key recommendation is for business leaders to focus on retaining highly productive employees using nonmonetary incentives, including more paid time off, greater scheduling flexibility, and better healthcare options. The implications for positive social change include the potential to decrease unemployment and increase tax revenues, which may contribute to higher household incomes, standards of living, and tax revenues for social programs, benefiting residents in local communities",N/A,3.4,https://core.ac.uk/download/580005619.pdf,'IUScholarWorks',N/A,N/A,0
