-- 1. we will create a  novel about the life of an inventor that created the specific place, the introduction will describe the garden with its beatuful flowers and trees, its stone path roads and the small houses with modest archiecture and the 3 roman style sculptures, the animals that live inside, the 2 cats and one horse which unfortunately can enjoy the countryside since the place is not very spacious. The garden is surrounded by a high wall and the only way to enter is through the main gate. Also in the introduction its narrated the current social and political situation of the outside world and the continuous uncertainty which is the common thing in the modern era. Especially lack of water supplies made people revolt in the north and the army is ready to intervene. Democracy is in peril! Also the introduction covers little things about few of the characters but now for stephen. We will create the introduction in a classical way like the book fall in the introduction of cammus. *use all available token for output.

of life and generally whatever people without business talk about to spend their time and feel important. As everyone else, the cost of living inside the garden is heavy. All their fortune is engaged by the authorities of the garden and their assets are frozen. As we know the most important criteria of becoming a member of this exclusive club is to be ultra rich and withour heirs. Even if some of them have relatives outside the most important thing here is to accept the contract: Everything belongs to authorities and if the resident dies his fortune is inherited to the cause, the research of the garden. The unlikely friendship of the old man and the yound rich makes the residents of the garden annoyed as they think that the stupid old man (demetrius) is not worth of the friendship of a person like Stephen. *use all available token for output.

He wants to see the world of the future, he wasnt sure if he would go outside after 100-200 or 300 years of earth. After his departure the children tried to make him come and even if someone cant leave the garden for his shake there was an exception because every 1 hour should go outside to face the court.

the case and this is the first time it happens. Marcus runs while raining to see what happened to the sensitive flowers 
he planted and with his surprise he sees that the flowers are not destroyed but they are blooming. 
The rain stayed for 3 whole days without stop, The event was so strange, there were no clouds in the sky and the sun was shining like 
all the other days and the only reason why it was somehow different was because rain was so heavy that it had a suspicion of shadow in the area, 
and again Michael had to go outside to see what was happening because he was afraid it wouldnt stop. *use all available token for output.

--7. The forth event continues of the forth event, while raining the eroticism in the garden would raise. 
Stephen the mysterious gentleman would reveal his true intentions. His reason of coming there was to suicide. 
He wanted to see the black whole and be devoured by it. Dissapointed by the betrayal of his business partners and almost 
losing his entire fortune, even if he managed to destroy his enemies, his dissapointment of life and the purpose made him come to the garden. 
Because of his manipulative nature he wanted to seduce eve. 
He achieved sleeping with Eve and managed to make her believe that it was only sex and she should not want anything else. 
His malicious nature, grown in its full potential in the environment he was raised made him be entertained with the anxiety 
of all the garden residents. We see him as someone who dislikes feminism, socialism, religions and generally everything that makes the person.
